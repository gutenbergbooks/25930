</span><h2 class="normal">Preface</h2>
<p>The present volume is, with the exception of one document, devoted to the religious and ecclesiastical affairs of the Philippines&#8212;mainly
in extracts from standard authorities on the religious history of the islands, combined in an appendix. Beginning with the
laws which concern missionaries to the Philippines (1585&#8211;1640), we present accounts of the ecclesiastical machinery of that
colony, the status of the various religious orders, the missions conducted by them, and other valuable information&#8212;showing
the religious condition of the islands at various times, from 1656 to 1899. These are obtained from Jesuit, Augustinian, Franciscan,
and Recollect chronicles, and from secular sources&#8212;the French scientist Le Gentil, the Spanish official Mas, and the German
traveler Jagor&#8212;thus enabling the student to consider the subject impartially as well as intelligently.

</p>
<p>Only two documents appear here in the usual chronological sequence; they belong to the years 1637&#8211;38. The officials of the
Augustinian order in the islands inform the king (September 9, 10, 1637) that the archbishop is making trouble for them over
the question of the &#8220;alternativa&#8221; in appointments to offices within the order; and ask the king not to believe all the reports
that may reach him about this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>matter. They add a memorial on the difficulties which Gregory XV&#8217;s decree establishing that alternativa have caused in the
Philippines; and relate their action in regard to the faction in their order who insist that an insignificant minority shall
have equal rights to offices with the better-qualified majority.

</p>
<p>The Jesuit Juan de Barrios, who accompanied Corcuera in his expedition against Jolo, relates (March&#8211;April, 1638) the events
of that campaign in letters to Manila. The Spaniards are repulsed several times in attacking the Moro stronghold, and one
of their divisions is surprised by the enemy with considerable loss to the Spaniards. Corcuera then surrounds the hill with
troops and fortifications, and begins a regular siege of the Moro fort; various incidents of this siege are narrated. On the
day after Easter the Moros, starved and sick, send Corcuera proposals for surrender; and finally they abandon their stronghold,
and take flight, leaving the Spaniards in possession of all their property as well as the fort. A letter from Zamboanga (perhaps
by Barrios) adds further particulars of the surrender and flight of the Joloans, the mortality among the Spaniards, the garrison
left there by Corcuera, etc.

</p>
<p>Taking up the general religious status of the islands, we select from the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de las leyes de Indias</i>, lib. i, tit. xiv, the laws that especially concern the religious in the Philippines, dated from 1585 to 1640. These persons
may not go to China or other countries, or return to Spain or Mexico, without special permission from the civil and ecclesiastical
authorities. Carmelites may go to the islands from Mexico. The missions must be so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>assigned that each order has its own territory, separate from the others. The usual supplies shall be given to such religious
as obtain permission to enter China and Japan; and all royal officials are directed to aid the fathers in their journeys,
and not to hinder them. Religious who lead scandalous lives, or have been expelled from their orders, may not remain in Filipinas.
The papal decrees <i lang="la">de alternativa</i> are to be enforced in the Indias. The restrictions imposed on religious going to the Japan missions are removed; all orders
may go, but are charged to set an example of harmony and fraternal behavior. The missionaries are forbidden to engage in commerce
or other business; the field shall be suitably divided among the various orders; and any bishops who may be appointed in Japan
shall be suffragan to the see of Manila. Clerics from Eastern India are not to be allowed to perform priestly functions in
Filipinas, or even to enter the islands. The proceeds resulting from the sale of the bulls of the Crusade must be placed in
the royal treasury, and not used in trade by the treasurers of the Crusade.

</p>
<p>The Jesuit Colin places at the end of his <i lang="es">Labor evang&eacute;lica</i> (Madrid, 1663) a statement&#8212;prepared, he says, in accordance with a command from the king&#8212;of the number of missions, houses,
and laborers supported by that order in the Philippines, a survey of its field and labors in the year 1656. He describes the
scope, functions, and resources of the colleges in Manila; the missions near that city; and, in their order, the residences
and missions maintained by the Society in the respective islands.

</p>
<p>An interesting account of the religious estate in the islands about 1735 is furnished by the Franciscan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>writer Juan Francisco de San Antonio. Beginning with the cathedral of Manila, he sketches its history from its earliest foundation,
and describes its building and service, with the salaries of its ecclesiastics; and adds biographical sketches (here omitted)
of the archbishops down to his time, and the extent of their jurisdiction. Then follow accounts, both historical and descriptive,
of the ecclesiastical tribunals, churches, colleges, and charitable institutions&#8212;especially of San Phelipe college and La
Misericordia. San Antonio enumerates the curacies in the archbishopric, and the convents and missions of the calced Augustinians.
He then describes the educational work of the Jesuits, giving a history of their colleges of San Ignacio and San Jos&eacute;, and
enumerates their houses and missions; another sketch furnishes similar information regarding the Dominicans, who have especial
charge of the Chinese residing in Luz&oacute;n. Like accounts are given of the Recollects, of the hospital brethren of St. John of
God, and of the author&#8217;s own order, the discalced Franciscans. On the same plan, he surveys the religious estate in all the
bishoprics suffragan to Manila; and, finally, computes the numbers of the Christian native population in the islands.

</p>
<p>Another survey of religious matters in the islands is furnished (about 1751) by the Jesuit Juan J. Delgado. He enumerates
the ministries of souls in methodical order, beginning with those held by the secular clergy in each diocese&#8212;in all, fifty-three.
Those of the calced Augustinians are noted in the same manner; then those of the Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, and Augustinian
Recollects; and the convents and hospitals of the hospital order of St. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>John of God. Among these are also mentioned the schools and colleges, and the hospitals, conducted by the orders. Delgado
states that the Christian population of the islands actually numbers over 900,000 persons; adding to this the children under
seven years of age, who are not enumerated by the missionaries, he estimates that it must exceed a million of souls. He enumerates
the numbers of villages and of their inhabitants who are in charge of each of the respective orders. He estimates the number
of tributes paid annually by the natives at a quarter of a million, and describes the requirements and mode of payment, and
the allotments made from the tributes for the support of religious instruction. He then relates in detail the number and remuneration
of all ecclesiastical offices, from bishop to cura. Delgado then describes the ecclesiastical tribunals of the islands, the
organization and good work of La Misericordia, and other charitable institutions in Manila, with the royal chapel, hospital,
and college.

</p>
<p>The French scientist Le Gentil describes (from observations made during 1766&#8211;68) the religious conditions in the islands.
He enumerates the benefices connected with Manila cathedral, and the salaries and duties of their incumbents; and the ecclesiastical
tribunals in that city&#8212;those of the archbishop, the Inquisition, and the Crusade. Then he relates interesting details about
the churches, convents, schools, and other institutions. Among these are the royal chapel, the seminary of San Felipe, the
seminary of Santa Isabela, the confraternity of La Misericordia, the universities, and the hospitals. Le Gentil describes
the ecclesiastical machinery of the suffragan dioceses, and the convents therein&#8212;all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>more extensive and costly than the population and wealth of the country justify. The rest of his account is devoted to &#8220;the
power and influence enjoyed by the religious in the Philippines.&#8221; He says: &#8220;Masters of the provinces, they govern there, as
one might say, as sovereigns; they are so absolute that no Spaniard dares go to establish himself there.... They are more
absolute in the Philippines than is the king himself.&#8221; They ignore the royal decrees that the Indian children must be taught
the Castilian language; thus the friars keep the Indians in bondage, and prevent the Spaniards from knowing the real state
of affairs in the provinces. They have refused to allow the visitations of the archbishops&#8212;a matter explained at considerable
length by the writer. The natives sometimes revolt, and then the friars cannot influence them, but troops must be sent to
punish the rebels. Le Gentil also relates the manner in which the friars punish the natives for not attending mass, by flogging
them&#8212;not only men, but women, and that in public.

</p>
<p>Sinibaldo de Mas, a Spanish official who spent some time at Manila, gives in his <i lang="es">Informe</i> (Madrid, 1843) a chapter regarding the character and influence of the friars&#8212;partly from his own observations, partly cited
from Comyn&#8217;s <i lang="es">Estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1810</i>, a valuable work, published at Madrid in 1820. He relates the difficulties encountered in the attempts so often made to subject
the friars to the diocesan visit. This has been at last accomplished, but, according to Mas, with resulting lower standards
of morality among the curas. He cites various decrees and instances connected with the controversies between the friars and
the authorities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>civil and religious; and then long extracts from Comyn, which show the great extent of the priestly influence, and the causes
therefor. Comyn regards the priests as the real conquerors of the islands, and as the most potent factor in their present
government&#8212;at least, outside of Manila. He shows how inadequate is the power of the civil government, apart from priestly
influence; recounts the beneficial achievements of the missionaries among the Indians; and deprecates the recent attempts
to restrict their authority. Mas approves Comyn&#8217;s views, and proceeds to defend the friars against the various charges which
have been brought against them. In support of his own opinions, he also cites Fray Manuel del Rio; and he himself praises
the public spirit, disinterestedness, and devotion to the interests of the Indians, displayed by the curas, many of whom are
friars. He argues that they even show too much patience and lenity toward the natives, who are lazy and indolent in the extreme;
and it has been a great mistake to forbid the priests to administer corporal punishment to delinquent natives. Mas is surprised
at the lack of religious in the islands, while in Spain there is an oversupply and the livings are much poorer than in the
Philippines. He enumerates the various dioceses, and the number of curacies in each, whether filled by regulars or seculars;
and concludes with an extract from the Jesuit writer Murillo Velarde, on the duties of the parish priest who ministers to
the Indians.

</p>
<p>A survey of the ecclesiastical system is presented (1850) in the <i lang="es">Diccionario de las Islas Filipinas</i> of the Augustinians Manuel Buzeta and Felipe Bravo. As in preceding writings of this sort, the different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>sees are separately described&#8212;in each being enumerated the territories of its jurisdiction, and its mode of government and
ecclesiastical courts; the number of curacies in it, and how served; and the number of other ecclesiastical officials, with
professors, seminarists, etc. In the account of Ceb&uacute; is inserted a letter (1831) from the bishop of that diocese, appealing
for its division into two.

</p>
<p>The German traveler Feodor Jagor presents (1873) an interesting view of the character and influence of the friars. He praises
their kindly and hospitable treatment of strangers, and the ability and knowledge that they often display; and defends those
whom he has known (mainly the Spaniards) from the charge of licentiousness. He discusses the relations between the curas and
civil alcaldes&#8212;the former being often the protectors of the Indians against the latter.

</p>
<p>A survey of the field and labors of the Augustinian Recollects is obtained from <i lang="es">Provincia de San Nicol&aacute;s de Tolentino de Agustinos descalzos</i> (Manila, 1879)&#8212;presented partly in translation, partly in synopsis. In it are enumerated the missions in charge of that order,
with the number of souls in each; frequently occurs an historical account of a mission&#8217;s foundation and growth, and biographical
mention of especially notable missionaries&#8212;including those who in early days were martyrs in Calamianes and Mindanao. It ends
with tables showing the numbers of tributes, souls, and ministers in the Recollect provinces, at various times.

</p>
<p>A sketch of the religious condition in the islands in 1896&#8211;98 is furnished by Jos&eacute; Algu&eacute; and other Jesuit fathers of Manila
in their compendious work, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span><i lang="es">Archipi&eacute;lago filipino</i> (Washington, 1900). Statistics showing the growth of the Christianized native population from 1735 to 1898 are compiled from
various sources&#8212;a remarkable increase, which the editors ascribe mainly to missionary labors. Then the various sees are enumerated,
with their bishops, cathedrals, courts, seminaries, and priests; and the various houses, colleges, and other institutions
possessed by the respective religious orders in the islands, besides the colleges of each in Spain. Considerable space is
devoted to a characterization of the religious spirit that prevails among the Filipinos; and to the conclusion that general
freedom of worship in that archipelago &#8220;would be a fatal measure to any government that rules the destinies of Filipinas,&#8221;
and might result in a politico-religious war. The American government is therefore warned not to allow such freedom in the
islands.

<p>Sire:

</p>
<p>In fulfilment of your Majesty&#8217;s commands and of the obligation that rests upon us as your Majesty&#8217;s loyal vassals and humble
chaplains, we have every year rendered account to your Majesty of the progress made by this province of Philipinas of our
father St. Augustine; and [have told you] how the religious of the province&#8212;whom your Majesty has sent to these regions, at
the cost of his royal estate, for the conversion of these peoples and the direction of those who are converted&#8212;are and have
been occupied, with the utmost solicitude, in fulfilling their obligations and your Majesty&#8217;s command by gathering rich fruits,
both spiritual and temporal.

</p>
<p>It is now eight years,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e395src" href="#xd0e395">1</a> Sire, since this province received a brief from his Holiness Gregory Fifteenth of blessed memory, that was obtained improperly,
through the efforts of the religious who are in this province who are born in these regions. In it his Holiness ordained that
all the elections among the said religious, from that of provincial to that of the most petty official, should be shared between
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>religious of these regions and those who have come from Espa&ntilde;a at your Majesty&#8217;s cost. The execution of this decree was impossible,
because the number of the said religious who were born in these regions was much less than that of the offices which, it was
ordained, must be conferred upon them. On this account, appeal was made to his Holiness, who was more clearly informed [about
the matter]. Nevertheless, these letters have caused great commotions in the order itself and in the community; for many persons
in the colony, on account of being kindred of the religious of this country, and many others who, like those religious, were
born here, have taken up the cause as their own&#8212;thinking that they are thus defending their native land. This is a difficulty
that may give rise to many others; and these provinces have during all this time suffered many anxieties and losses, as will
appear from the reports which we are sending to your Majesty with this letter. This year it pleased our Lord that another
brief should come, from his Holiness Urban Eighth, which revoked the former brief of Gregory Fifteenth. It was sent to the
archbishop of this city of Manila, so that he might&#8212;as the truth of the allegations made in Rome by the father-general of
our holy order was evident&#8212;annul the former brief, and leave the elections of this province in the liberty which our constitutions
provide, without any discrimination between nationalities. We gave many thanks to our Lord for the favor that He had granted
us; for, with this second brief, we promised ourselves the peace and quiet that are necessary in order that we all may more
freely occupy ourselves in our Lord&#8217;s service, and in fulfilling the purpose for which your Majesty was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>pleased to send us to these lands. But such was not the case; for the archbishop was angry (according to what we can understand
of the matter) because in the former year of 35 we followed the cathedral church, during his absence, in the observance of
an interdict which he had laid on this city&#8212;a proceeding which he greatly resented because, he said when he returned to this
city, the interdict had not been raised by his order or with his consent. Now, as this business has come into his hands, he
is giving us many opportunities for gaining merits; and although the narration made in the brief is so accurate and truthful
that there is nothing more evident, he has displayed his cognizance of it by reducing it to the terms of an ordinary litigation,
and has made plain his intention, which is to exceed the commission that his Holiness gives him in the brief&#8212;to the very considerate
prejudice and injury of this province and of the observance of our holy constitutions. By his conduct the opposition that
we have thus far suffered from lay persons born in these regions has been continually stimulated&#8212;to such an extent that Don
Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, the governor of these islands, saw that he had reason to fear some bad ending to such beginnings;
and therefore, with the prudence and carefulness which he displays in all matters concerning his government, he suppressed
the disturbances which were being stirred up.

</p>
<p>We do not know, Sire, how this will result, although we strive in all things to possess our souls in patience; and we trust
to the justice of the governor of these islands, that he will protect us in all that our just claims and rights shall permit.
For we can have only this consolation in the present emergency, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>that violence is threatened against us; and that the protection which the governor of these islands has extended to your Majesty&#8217;s
vassals in such cases, and his defense of the royal patronage, have been the occasion of the commotions and troubles which
have occurred in this city during these last two years. For if the archbishop had chosen to avert them he could have done
so, without losing anything of his jurisdiction, or failing to meet the obligations of a vigilant prelate.

</p>
<p>Accordingly, we entreat your Majesty not to give entire credit to all the reports about this matter that are written to your
Majesty from this country; for we know how persons regard our affairs at present, and that many are ruled by prejudice, and
not by the facts in the case. The same risk is run in other matters, for there never was a judge who could please all persons.
What we can assert and certify to your Majesty is the great zeal which Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera has always displayed
in the service of God and your Majesty, and in the increase of the royal estate. For in his own life he sets an example to
the most devout religious; and in his personal attention to the duties of his offices he continues without being turned aside
to anything else. His actions are guided by the law of God and the service of your Majesty. He is vigilant in preventing all
offenses against God, and in military discipline. It seems as if our Lord has aided him, in consequence of this; for it is
in his time that these islands of your Majesty, and your vassals, find themselves in a condition of peace, without being harassed
by so many enemies as neighboring nations have&#8212;who have inflicted on them so much damage through many previous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>years, with pillage, fire, murder, and captivity. And as the most powerful enemy was the king of Mindanao, last year the governor
went in person to punish him in his own kingdom; and he conquered that king and gained possession of two fortresses, the most
important that he had, with many cannons, muskets, and other fire-arms. From this campaign the arms of your Majesty have gained
much reputation, and all the enemies of these islands are intimidated; while the vassals whom your Majesty has in them are
more established in their obedience. If that fortunate victory had not occurred as it did, there might have been much reason
to fear for the allegiance that the peoples of these islands owe to your Majesty. And Don Sebastian deserves that your Majesty
bestow upon him greater rewards, since in more important posts the services which he can render to your royal crown will be
greater. May our Lord guard your royal person, granting you the prosperity which your Majesty&#8217;s many realms ask from God,
and of which they have need. Manila, September 9, 1637. Your Majesty&#8217;s chaplains, who kiss your royal feet,

<p><i>Relation of events in the Philipinas province of the Order of St. Augustine, and of the effects caused therein by the letters
of his Holiness Gregory XV in which he commanded that the elections for offices, from the provincial to the most petty official,
should be made alternately between the two parties&#8212;one, the religious who took the habit in Espa&ntilde;a and came to these islands
for the conversion of the infidels and the direction of those who are converted; the other, the religious who have entered
the order in the Indias.</i>


</p>
<p>This province of Philipinas of the order of our father St. Augustine has enjoyed, from the time of its foundation at the conquest
of these islands, the utmost peace in its ordinary government; and it is by virtue of this that it has accomplished so great
results in the service of the two majesties [<i>i.e.</i>, God and the king of Spain]&#8212;being always occupied in the conversion of these peoples, and in the direction of those who are
converted; and devoting so much care to the fulfilment of its obligations, even when the results of their labors made their
devotion so manifest. In this state the order was maintained, making great progress in the gain of souls, until the year 29,
in which this said province received a brief from his Holiness Gregory XV, in which he commanded that the elections in the
province, from that of provincial to that of the most petty official, should be made alternately between the religious who
had come from Espa&ntilde;a at the cost of his Majesty, and those who had entered the order in these regions. The brief was laid
before the province;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e446src" href="#xd0e446">2</a> but it had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>been obtained by misrepresentations, and its execution was impossible because the religious who had taken the habit in the
Indias were very few, numbering less than one-third as many men as were the offices which the said brief commanded to be given
to them. For these reasons, the province appealed from the execution of the decree; but, although this appeal was so just
and so conformable to law, the judge whom they had appointed to execute the decree<a class="noteref" id="xd0e457src" href="#xd0e457">3</a> refused to allow it, declaring that we were publicly excommunicated. Afterward, the royal Audiencia here, to whom we had
recourse with a plea of fuerza, declared that the judge had committed it against us in not allowing the said petition and
appeal, that it might go before his Holiness. Then the judge, compelled by the royal Audiencia, admitted the said appeal,
and set a time when it should be brought before the authorities at Roma. In order to serve better the interests of this province,
we appeared, through our procurators, within the allotted time at Roma, and furnished official statements presented by us,
with all due solemnity.

</p>
<p>But this was not sufficient to make the religious who took the habit in the Indias cease from disturbing the peace of the
province; for they appointed, in the year 35, another judge to execute the said brief. He undertook to establish his judicature
by proceeding against us with harsh and violent acts, and caused us much anxiety; for he was aided by nearly all the lay persons
of this colony who were born in these islands, who took up this cause as their own. They caused many disturbances, and used
language so offensive that they obliged the honorable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>and well-intentioned people of this city to come to our defense. This was done by the bishop of the city of Sant&iacute;simo Nombre
de Jesus in &Ccedil;ubu, who was then governing this archbishopric; for as judge of the ordinary he demanded from the said judge-executor
the documents by virtue of which the latter had erected a tribunal within his territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e464src" href="#xd0e464">4</a> Under the compulsion of censures and pecuniary fines, the said judge-executor gave up the documents; and his Lordship, having
examined them, declared that they were not sufficient.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e467src" href="#xd0e467">5</a> This declaration was supported and favored by Don Juan Cere&ccedil;o de Salamanca, who was at that time governor of these islands;
and he also interposed the superior authority of the office which he filled, to calm and quiet in their beginnings these commotions&#8212;which
threatened, if they should increase, much greater troubles. They were quieted for the time; but in the following year, 36,
those religious again nominated another judge<a class="noteref" id="xd0e473src" href="#xd0e473">6</a> to execute the said brief, who began to carry out this commission with even greater violence than the two former judges displayed.
His conduct was such that we could not protect ourselves, although we protested that this cause devolved upon his Holiness;
and we offer here the authentic testimony of our statement presented in course of appeal, the tenor of which is as follows:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By this present public instrument be it known to all that in the year of the birth of our same Lord Jesus Christ, 1631, the
fourteenth indiction, the twenty-ninth day of March, and the eighth year of the pontificate of our most holy father in Christ
and our lord Urban VIII, by divine Providence pope, the reverend brethren of the Order of Saint Augustine resident in the
province of the Philippines, who made their profession in Spain, have proceeded against the brethren similarly resident in
the same province, who were received into the order in the Indias. As filed in my office, etc.

</p>
<p>&#8220;To the petition in the memorial and brief as presented, the reverend father Master Peter Ribadeneira,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e484src" href="#xd0e484">7</a> assistant [general] for the Spains and procurator for the Indias [or Philippines], made answer as follows: That his clients
were not bound thereto, inasmuch as the said ordinances could not be carried into effect by reason of impossibility, since
the brethren who were given the habit [of the order] in the Indias are fewer in number than the offices [<i>or</i> positions] to be filled [by the same]; wherefore the decree <i>de alternativa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e495src" href="#xd0e495">8</a> cannot be complied with in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>the conferral of the said offices. Moreover, that the said brief was obtained without a hearing of his clients, and therefore
is surreptitious, besides being contrary to truth in that the charge was made therein that a sedition had taken place among
the [brethren]. Wherefore protest has been entered that no further steps be taken unless by [due process of law], etc.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereupon I the undersigned, a notary-public, have been requested to have made and drawn up one or more public instruments
in reference to all and singular the above, according as may be needed or demanded.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Done at Rome in my office, etc., of the Rione del Ponte,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e524src" href="#xd0e524">9</a> in the presence and hearing and cognizance of Don Bernardino Pacheto<a class="noteref" id="xd0e530src" href="#xd0e530">10</a> and Don Jacobo Francisco Belgio, fellow-notaries and witnesses, especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>called, requested, and summoned to all and singular the above.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>

</p>
<p>We also present an original letter from the general of our order, and another from the father assistant of the province of
Espa&ntilde;a, in which they tell us how his Holiness had already revoked the said brief; also another letter, from the procurator
of this province at that court [<i>i.e.</i>, Madrid], in which he notified us that he had presented the brief of revocation in the royal Council of the Indias. But,
notwithstanding these letters, the religious who had taken the habit in the Indias persisted all the more in persuading their
judge to hurry forward the legal proceedings and to urge on the acts of violence which he was executing against us; and in
this importunity, and in the opposition which the said religious made to the letters and advices of the general and of the
assistant in the Spanish provinces, was admirably displayed the obedience and respect that they have for their superior. At
this juncture also arose disturbances made by the relatives of the said religious, occasioning many scandals; and the friars,
encouraged by the support which these people gave them, could not be corrected within the convent, and disturbed it to the
utmost. They made promises to the lay brethren to ordain them as priests in order to draw these into their following; and
<i>so</i> far did they go that all of them together sallied out from the convent one morning&#8212;the second day of August in last year&#8212;more
than two hours before daylight, and carried with them the doorkeeper and three lay brethren, leaving the gates of the convent
open<span class="corr" id="xd0e548" title="Not in source">.</span> Roaming through the streets at those hours, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>very great scandal, they went where they chose until daylight; and then they went to the palace, where they presented themselves
before the governor of these islands, Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera&#8212;demanding, under pretext of desiring freedom to prosecute
their just claims, that he shelter them under the royal patronage, take them out of the [Augustinian] convent, and assign
them another where they could reside. The governor, with the prudence and great zeal which he displays in all the affairs
of his government, rebuked them for this proceeding, ordered that the provincial be summoned, and charged him to take the
religious back to the convent, but to treat them kindly; and, although recognizing the serious nature of their act, he requested
the provincial not to punish them for it, and the latter acted in accordance with the governor&#8217;s wishes.

</p>
<p>But those religious continued to cause much mischief and trouble, and there was reason to fear other and greater difficulties.
The procedure of the judge was so violent that he went so far as to issue an act in which he represented the preceding [session
of the] chapter as nugatory, and commanded the provincial, with penalties and censures, to surrender within two hours the
seal of the province, so that it might be given to the person on whom the said judge should see fit to bestow it. They delayed
notification of this act to the provincial until sunset, so that he could not reply within the time set; and as soon as morning
came, they declared that he had incurred censures. The governor of these islands, as your Majesty&#8217;s lieutenant, interposed
the authority of his office; and thus were prevented the great injuries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>that were beginning outside the order&#8212;and, within it, the disturbance and schism which had begun. This was done by means of
an act issued by the judge, in which he suspended the former act, and decided that the trial of this cause should be deferred
for forty days before the [next] chapter-meeting. Therewith this province remained in peace and quiet,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e557src" href="#xd0e557">11</a> and all the religious attended to their obligations&#8212;until the arrival, in this year of thirty-seven, of the bull for this
province, passed by the royal Council of the Indias, in which our most holy father Urban Eighth revoked the brief for the
<i>alternativa</i>; its tenor is as follows:

</p>
<p>&#8220;Since, however, it has lately been reported to us by our beloved son, the prior-general of the order<a class="noteref" id="xd0e568src" href="#xd0e568">12</a> of the brothers hermits of Saint Augustine, that in the aforesaid province nearly all the brethren of Spanish blood of the
said order resident therein were sent to those countries at the expense of our very dear son in Christ, Philip, the Catholic
king of the Indias, in order that they might labor for the conversion of heathens and the instruction of converts; that moreover
in the province and order of the aforesaid brethren in those countries there are very few [brethren] known as creoles [<i lang="es">criolli</i>], who are fit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>for the charge of those peoples: Therefore in the letters presented as inserted ahead, in view moreover of the fact that it
is impossible to have the law carried out since the creole brethren are not numerous enough to fill the aforesaid offices
with the care of souls attached thereto, an appeal has been taken to us and to the apostolic see to have the said decrees
set aside. Hence the said prior-general has humbly petitioned us of our apostolic kindness to make due provision in the premises.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore hearkening to the petition of the said prior-general, desirous moreover of rewarding him with especial favors and
graces [we hereby,] in order that these presents alone be carried into effect, do absolve him and declare him thus absolved
from whatsoever excommunication, suspension, interdict, and other ecclesiastical sentences, censures, and penalties incurred
by law or individual court, should he in any manner have been entangled thereby; moreover through these presents we charge
and order your fraternity that, should the petition be grounded on truth, you interpret benignly and recall the letters inserted
ahead, to the end that by our apostolic authority the elections for the future be free, in accordance with the constitutions
of the said order, the same as if the letters inserted ahead had not been issued. The same letters inserted ahead and all
other things to the contrary notwithstanding.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Given in Castel Gandolfo<a class="noteref" id="xd0e583src" href="#xd0e583">13</a> of the diocese of Albano, under the seal of the Fisherman, the eighteenth day of May, the year one thousand six hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>and thirty-four, and the eleventh year of our pontificate.&#8221;

</p>
<p>This entire clause appears inserted in the brief, after the relation which is made therein of the brief which his Holiness
Gregory XV issued in favor of the alternate elections&#8212;which is the one which his Holiness [Urban VIII] revoked by the said
letters, as appears by them. We presented this brief to the archbishop of Manila, to whom its execution came committed, with
the cognizance of the clause <i lang="la">si preces veritate nitantur</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e596src" href="#xd0e596">14</a> and with the said brief the attorneys for our cause presented three certified statements by the provincial and definitory
of this province, drawn from its books, and sworn to and signed by all. In one of these statements is contained the number
of the religious in this province who took the habit and made profession in the kingdoms of Espa&ntilde;a. Of these there are ninety-three,
among whom are two youths graduated in theology; ten lecturers in arts and theology; thirty preachers who completed their
studies in the realms and universities of Espa&ntilde;a, and in that country received their diplomas as preachers; and twenty-four
preachers who came to these islands before they completed their studies, and received that title in these provinces. In another
statement is contained the number of the religious in this province who have taken the habit in the Indias; these are thirty-three.
Six of them should be excluded: two of these are of Portuguese nationality, sons of the Congregation of Yndia&#8212;who, by a decree
of his Majesty, and the decision of a full definitory of this province, are commanded to return to their own congregation.
Two others are prevented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>from saying mass&#8212;one by old age, and the other by having been insane more than fifteen years. Another is of Japanese nationality;
and the sixth is a mestizo, son of a Portuguese father and a Japanese mother. At the foot of this memorandum is a declaration
by the definitory that there are other persons on the list therein who are disqualified, legally and by our constitutions,
from holding offices in our holy order&#8212;whom, if it should be necessary, they will make known. In the third certificate is
contained the number of offices that this province furnishes; there are eighty-four of these, in which must be counted the
sixty-six convents of the order which are residences of ministers, and three others which are communities. The archbishop
accepted these certified statements, and commanded, by an act which he issued officially, that the two religious who acted
as attorneys for the religious who had taken the habit in the Indias should be notified of these statements; and that when
they had examined and understood the papers, they must declare under oath whether these were authentic and legal, and if they
had anything to add to them. After the said attorneys had examined and understood them, they declared that the statements
were accurate and truthful; and likewise, by a juridical act of his Lordship, the same notification was made to seven or eight
other religious of the same faction of the Yndias, who also under oath declared that the statements were accurate and truthful.
Notwithstanding this evidence, the archbishop began to allow petitions from the said attorneys for the party of the Yndias,
in which they promised to furnish evidence that the narration made in the said brief was false&#8212;saying that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>word <i>paucisimi</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;very few&#8221;], which is in the said brief, signified no more than two or three; and that the words <i lang="la">inepti ad administrationem populorum</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;not fit for the charge of those peoples&#8221;] meant unfitness of the intellect; and they endeavored to prove that they were
competent and capable for the offices that the province had. The religious of Espa&ntilde;a opposed this, evidence, saying that such
was not the signification of those words; for <i lang="la">paucisimi</i> was understood with respect to the offices, and <i lang="la">inepti ad administrationem populorum</i> meant lack of strength in their numbers&#8212;as farther down the same brief explained it in the words: <i lang="la">Quod dicti patres in numero suficiente apti non sint</i>, and <i lang="la">oficiorum prefatorum distributione</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e629src" href="#xd0e629">15</a> And as for the arguments adduced at Roma when this matter was presented in course of appeal&#8212;which were stated in the testimony,
as is most clearly evident&#8212;those religious did not oppose these allegations, or many others which were made to his Lordship.
To him were also presented several protests against the injuries which this province, in their general opinion and belief,
had to suffer, and, as many individuals of their number thought, difficulties which might arise from furnishing the said information,
as a reason why his Lordship might fail to accept this statement of the case. These difficulties appear, and in fact have
begun to make trouble with persons outside of the order. The religious of Espa&ntilde;a saw this; and they knew that the witnesses
who gave their testimony in the case could not have knowledge of all the religious in this province who have taken the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>habit in the Yndias, nor of their qualifications, nor for what offices they were suitable according to our constitutions;
moreover, they heard that it was certain that the said fathers of the Yndias faction were representing and alleging their
own suitability [for those offices]&#8212;the purpose of these efforts being to establish by them new pretensions in the two courts
[of Madrid and Roma], and with those representations to cause fresh disturbances and uneasiness in this province. To obviate
this mischief, and to make clear and evident the justice in the claims of both sides, and to prevent gossip by persons outside
of the order regarding the qualifications of the religious, the fathers of Castilla presented a petition in which was inserted
a memorandum of the religious in this province who belonged to the Yndias faction; these are thirty-three, the same as those
mentioned in the certified statement of the definitory that was presented earlier. Constrained by necessity and the strait
in which they found themselves, the fathers of Espa&ntilde;a testified, under oath and in legal form, in what manner fifteen of the
religious mentioned in the said petition were disqualified or disabled, by law and the constitutions of our order, for holding
official positions in the order. They also demanded that, of the eighteen who remained, the attorneys of the Yndias faction
should declare, for each separately and in detail, what learning and competency he possessed; whether he had been a student
in any course of science or arts, and where and at what time; for what offices in the order he was competent, according to
our constitutions; and in which of the four provinces which this province [of St. Augustine] administers&#8212;in which it is necessary
to know <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>the Tag&aacute;l, Pampanga, Ylocan, and Bisayan tongues, which are all different languages&#8212;each of those religious was a minister.
[They were also asked to name] those who had sufficient fluency in the language to preach the gospel and declare the mysteries
of the faith to the Indians; and whether there were any religious of their faction who were qualified to be preachers in this
convent of Manila and in other Spanish towns and convents; whether there were any such religious capable of teaching arts
and theology (both moral and scholastic), or of deciding the difficult questions that are wont to arise regarding the administration
of the sacraments in the provinces. The fathers of Castilla stated that, when the truth of these matters should be ascertained,
they were ready to make concessions, without the necessity of a formal investigation; and that in matters where there was
any doubt, they would have the religious appear before his Lordship [the archbishop], so that before him and the professors
of the two universities of this city, or before the superiors of the religious orders, they might be examined by the official
examiners of this province, and their qualifications be made evident. They have made no reply to this request, and we fear
that the archbishop will not oblige them to answer it&#8212;inasmuch as in the number of the said eighteen religious not eight will
be found who can in strictness be considered qualified to hold an office <i lang="la">cum cura animorum</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;with the care of souls&#8221;], and not one for positions as professors or preachers in this city of Manila, while only two are
well versed in cases of conscience.

</p>
<p>The affair remains in this condition, and we do not know how it will end; for in this country justice and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>law do not secure, to one who seeks justice, the attainment of his object. Done at this convent of St. Augustine in Manila,

Indias. The latter were known as Creoles (<i>crioli</i>)&#8212;thus in the Constitutions of the order, of 1685, where reference is made to decrees of Gregory XV, dated November 29, 1621

in all those colonies. Later, in Mexico, the statutes of the Augustinians required that in provincial chapters religious of
Spanish blood should be chosen alternately with those of Indian, in the election of provincials, definitors, priors, and other
officers; but this plan did not operate very satisfactorily.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rev. T. C. Middleton</span>, O.S.A.

</span><h2 class="normal">Corcuera&#8217;s Campaign in Jolo</h2>
<p>In my last letter I wrote to your Reverence of the result of the first attack&#8212;which was unfortunate, because the Moros repulsed
us, as I told your Reverence. Not less unfortunate will be the news that I shall now relate,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e680src" href="#xd0e680">1</a> which it is yet necessary for me to tell, in order to fulfil my duty and to remove the clouds arising from rumors and letters
that will go there. I am here and see everything; and there is never a lack of those who tell many new things, and exaggerate
matters that are not so great as they will relate and descant there, where no one can report and declare what has happened.
It is as follows.

</p>
<p>Since that attack, we have made two others. The first was with five mines which we had made, with which we expected to blow
up a great part of those walls. All of the mines were fired, and, thinking that they would cause the same effects as the others,
our men retired farther than they ought to have done. Four of the mines exploded, and did not a little damage among the enemy.
They, full of fear, fled down from their position; but, as the mines did not make the noise that we expected, we did not,
accordingly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>get there in time, as we were quite distant because of our fear lest the mines do us harm. The Moros retook their position,
so that we were repulsed this time, as we had been the other&#8212;with the death of a captain, while some men were wounded. The
fifth mine was left, and did not explode that time. Hence its mouth was looked for, and having found it, we tried two days
after that to make another assault. The assault was made after the mine had exploded. That mine was larger than the others
had been, and caused much damage. But the Moros fortified themselves again, with greater strength than they had the last two
times; and defended themselves in their trenches, which had been fortified with many stockades and terrepleins, so that we
could not enter. We lost some soldiers on that occasion, who tried to show that they were bold and valiant. Among them was
the sargento-mayor Melon, who was struck by a ball which passed through him and carried him off in two days. May God rest
his soul! Thereupon, we retired to our posts, and endeavored to collect our men and carry away the wounded, who were many.
We have lost four captains of renown in these three assaults&#8212;namely, Captain Pimienta, Captain Juan Nicolas, Captain Don Pedro
de Mena, and Sargento-mayor Gonzales de Caseres Melon. Besides these three assaults, another misfortune happened to us, on
St. Matthew&#8217;s day, which was as follows. Captain Rafael Ome, going with forty-six men and two hundred Indians to make a <i>garo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e689src" href="#xd0e689">2</a> (as we say here), and having taken up quarters in a field, where there was a fortified house, arranged his posts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>at intervals and ordered his men to be on their guard. But since man proposes and God disposes, the posts were either careless,
or God ordained it thus; for suddenly the enemy rushed upon our men, who could not unite, as they were by that time scattered
through the forest. The enemy, having caught them off their guard, made a pastime of it, killing twenty-six men, and carrying
off arms, powder, balls, and fuses. I regard that event as the greatest of all our losses. Among those of our men killed there
by the enemy was Captain Lopez Suarez, a fine soldier. Our men were not disheartened by these reverses, except such and such
men. The governor well sustains the undertaking with [all his powers of] mind and body. He has surrounded the entire hill
with a stockade and a ditch, and has sown the ground with sharp stakes so that the enemy may neither receive aid nor sally
out from it. At intervals there are sentry-posts and towers, so close that they almost touch. There were six barracks along
it, so that if any tower should be in need the soldiers in them could go to its defense. Some of them have six men, others
four, and those which have least three men, as a guard. The enclosure is one legua long and surrounds the hill. I do not know
which causes the more wonder, the fort of the Moros or the enclosure of the Spaniards&#8212;which restrains the Moros, so that they
issue but seldom, and then at their peril. We are day by day making gradual advances. Today a rampart was completed which
is just even with their stockades, so that we shall command the hill equally [with the enemy]. God helping, I hope that we
shall reduce their trenches, and then we shall advance from better to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>better. May God aid us; and <i lang="la">si Dominus a custodierit civitatem frustra vigilat qui custodit eam</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e702src" href="#xd0e702">3</a> Father, prayers and many of them are needed. Will your Reverence have them said in your holy college, and excuse me and all
of us for what we can not do. I forward this letter, [hoping] for its good fortune in the holy sacrifices of your Reverence,
etc. Jolo, March 31, 1638. To the father-prior of Manila.


</p>
<p><i>Pax Christi, etc.</i>

</p>
<p>I would like to be the bearer of this letter, and to fulfil my desires of seeing your Reverence and all the fathers and brothers
of your Reverence&#8217;s holy college. That is a proposition for which credit may be given me, but the time gives space only to
suffer; and thus do we have to accommodate ourselves to it, and to check our desires, drawing strength from weakness. I must
content myself with writing, which would be a pleasant task, if I could do it at my leisure, and not so hastily as I have
made known in certain letters that I have sent to your Reverence&#8212;not losing or neglecting any occasion at which I could write.
And so that this opportunity should not pass without a letter from me, I have hastened my pen beyond my usual custom, and
have written very concisely and briefly&#8212;although I could write at greater length, and give account of many things which I
leave for a better occasion. That will be when it is the Lord&#8217;s pleasure for us to see each other. Moreover, I have no pleasant
news to write, since that which I could write would all be to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>effect that we have not gained this enchanted hill; and that, at the times when we have tempted fortune, we have retired with
loss of some men and many wounded.

</p>
<p>Continuing, then, in the same style as the last letter, I declare that since the first assault, in which we were driven back
with the loss of Captain Don Pedro Mena Pando, Adjutant Oliva, and Alf&eacute;rez Trigita, we have made two other assaults. One was
on the twenty-fourth of March, the eve of our Lady of the Assumption. The second was on the twenty-eighth of the same month.
In the first, we trusted to the mines that had been made, by means of which we expected to make a safe entrance. We would
have made it had our fear of receiving harm from them matched the little fear of the enemy&#8212;who, as barbarians, did not prepare
for flight, although they knew our designs. Of the five mines, four blew up; and as was seen, and as we afterward learned
here from some captives, there was a great loss to the enemy. As soon as they saw the fire, they took to flight; but our men,
being at a distance, could not come up to seize the posts that the enemy abandoned, until very late. That gave the Moros time
to take precautions, so that when we had come up, it was impossible to gain a single thing which the mines had given us. On
that occasion both sides fought very valiantly. The wounded on our side were not many, and our dead even fewer; among the
latter was Captain Pimienta. We were forced to return to our posts without having gained more than the damage wrought by the
mines. The loss of those people was considerable, while not few of them perished because of the severity of our fire. But
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>opportunity of the fifth mine which remained (which could not have its effect, because the fire-channel of the others choked
it), the third attack was made inside of two days, by first setting fire to that mine, and by arranging the men better than
on the day of the previous assault. They were set in array by the governor, who in person came up to these quarters on that
occasion. They set fire to the mine, and more was accomplished than on the preceding days. Many of the enemy were killed;
but, as the entrance was so deeply recessed, it could not be forced so freely by us, for the Moros were able to defend it
from us, with so great valor that we could not take it. Our men fought with so great spirit and courage that it was necessary
for the leaders to use force with them in order to get the men to retire, when they saw the so superior force of the enemy.
On that occasion they killed seven of our men, besides wounding many. Among the latter was Sargento-mayor Melon, who was shot
through the lung by a ball. He died on the second day, to the grief of all this army. Thereupon his Lordship made his men
retire to their quarters, and commanded that the fort should not be attacked, but that they should proceed to gain it by the
complete blockade of the enemy, as we are doing. By this method, I think that we shall make an entrance into the fort. Already
we have one bulwark, which we have made level with their entrenchments; and we are raising our works one and one-half varas
above them, so that we are dislodging them with our artillery. They are retiring to the interior of their fort. By this means
we hope to gain entrance into all their forts; and, once masters of them, I trust by God&#8217;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>help that we shall conquer their stronghold, and that they will humble themselves to obey God and the king.

</p>
<p>Before those assaults, on St. Matthew&#8217;s day, Captain Raphael Ome went out to make a <i>garo</i>, as they say here, and to overrun the country. In this island the level country is heavily wooded as nearly all of it is
mountainous.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e727src" href="#xd0e727">4</a> He took in his company about fifty men [<i>i.e.</i>, Spaniards] and two hundred Caraga Indians. The captain reached a field, and having lodged in a fortified house, such as
nearly all those houses are (for those Indians of the mountain, who are called Guimennos,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e736src" href="#xd0e736">5</a> build them for their defense), he placed his sentries and seized the positions that he judged most dangerous. But since <i lang="la">non est volentis neque currentis</i>, etc., either because of the great multitude and the wiliness of the enemy, or (as is more certain) because the sentries
were careless, and the other men asleep, the enemy came suddenly and attacked our soldiers&#8212;with so great fury <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>that they killed twenty-six men, among whom was Captain Lopez Suarez, a brave soldier. The leader and captain, Ome, was in
great danger. He fought in person with so great valor that, although run through with a spear, he attacked and defeated his
opponent, laying him dead at his feet. Few of our men aided him, and many of them retreated immediately, thus allowing the
enemy to capture from us twenty firearms, with fuses, powder, and balls. That was a great loss, and it is certain that we
have not hitherto had a greater. And if any loss has occurred, it has been due to the neglect and confidence of the Spaniard.

</p>
<p>Today two Bassilan Indians came down from the hill to ask for mercy, and for passage to their own country. They say that they
are sent by the datos in the stronghold who came from that island of Bassila or Taquima; and that, if permission and pardon
were given to them by the <i>pari</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, Corcuera], one hundred and thirty of them would come down in the morning. We regard this as a trick of that Moro; and, although
it may be as they say, we are taking precautions, and are watching for whatever may happen. It they should come, they will
be well received; and that will not be a bad beginning to induce others to come from the hill. I shall advise your Reverence
of such event on the first occasion. What we know that they are suffering within [the fort] is the disease of smallpox and
discharges of blood, together with great famine; because we have surrounded the entire hill with ditches and stockades, set
with sharp stakes, which run around it for more than one and one-half leguas, and within musket-shot [of their fort] is a
sentry-post [<i>garita</i>] or tower <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>in which three men and three Bantayas are staying. By that means the enemy cannot enter or go out without being seen; and,
when they do that, they are given such a bombardment that scarcely does any one dare to go outside of their walls. The hill
is a beautiful sight, and if it were enjoying holy peace instead of war, it would be no small matter of entertainment and
recreation to survey the landscape at times. The Moro does not like to see us, and is looking at us continually from his stronghold
and yelling and scoffing at us&#8212;as they say sometimes that the Spaniards are chickens; again, that they are sibabuyes;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e760src" href="#xd0e760">6</a> and again, that they will come to set fire to us all, and kill us. The Moro is a great rascal and buffoon. I trust in God
that in a little while He will be ready for our thanksgivings [for the defeat of the Moros]. Will your Reverence urge His
servants to aid us with their sacrifices and prayers. Those, I believe, it will be that must give us the victory, and that
must humble the arrogance of this Mahometan. His Lordship is displaying great firmness and patience, as he is so great a soldier.
Already has he almost raised a stone fort on the beach, for he intends to leave a presidio here, and I think that it will
be almost finished before he leaves. Nothing else occurs to me. Of whatever else may happen, your Reverence will be advised
on the first occasion. If I have gone to considerable length in this letter, it is because I have known, one day ahead, of
the departure of this champan. I commend myself many times to the holy sacrifices of your Reverence. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>letter will also serve for our father provincial, etc. Jolo, April 5, one thousand six hundred and thirty-eight.

</p>
<p>The Moro has returned today with a letter from the queen and all the stronghold, in which they beg pardon and humiliate themselves.
May God grant it, and bring them to His knowledge. I shall advise you of the result. I hear that Dato Achen is dead. If that
is so, then the end has come. Today, the sixth of the above month.

</p>
<p><i>Pax Christi</i>

</p>
<p><i lang="la">Deo gracias qui dedit nobis victoriam per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e776src" href="#xd0e776">7</a> I have written your Reverence another letter, by way of Othon, telling you that it was our Lord&#8217;s pleasure to give us a joyous
Easter-tide, the beginning of what has happened. His Divine Majesty has chosen to bestow upon us an overflowing blessing,
by the reduction of these Moros so that they should come, abased and humiliated, to beg His governor for mercy; for, whether
it was the latter&#8217;s plan to go to treat for peace at Basilan for their men, or whether they should send them all, that they
might see how the governor viewed their petition, the following day they came with letters from the queen<a class="noteref" id="xd0e779src" href="#xd0e779">8</a> for Father Pedro Gutierrez and his Lordship. Therein she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>begged the father to protect her, for she wished to come to throw herself at the feet of the <i>hari</i> of Manila, and to beg his pardon for the obstinacy that they had shown hitherto. The father answered for his Lordship, in
regard to the pardon, that if they agreed to do what was right, they would be very gladly pardoned; but that in regard to
their coming it was not time, until they would humbly give up the arms which they had taken from us, and the captives, vessels,
and holy ornaments; and that, even though the queen had so great authority, so long as the king did not come, he must declare
and show his willingness to accept what the queen had written. Accordingly, the king wrote to the same father and to his Lordship
next day, begging the same thing and more earnestly. But he was not allowed to come&#8212;which he urgently entreated&#8212;until they
should have given up the arms and other things of which they had robbed us. Difficulties arose over this point, as to which
of the two things was to be done first. The Moro declared that he wished to treat first of the peace, and the points on which
they were to agree; and therefore it was necessary to see the <i>hari</i> of Manila first of all. But Don Sebastian, as he was so experienced in these matters of war (in which God has inspired him
with so wise resolutions, and given him even better results), held firm to his proposals. Two days passed, but at last the
king agreed to the terms, by giving up the pieces of artillery which he had captured from us. There were four iron pieces;
and, in place of one which had burst, one of bronze was requested, which many mines had buried. Afterward we found the broken
piece, by opening the mouth of one of the mines; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>and he gave it to us willingly&#8212;saying that he had thus brought the broken piece, and that he ought not for that reason to
give another in its place; and that that which had been asked from him had been bought for forty <i>basines</i> of gold at Macazar. In order that the Spaniards might see what an earnest desire for a permanent peace was in his heart,
and that he was greatly inclined to it, he sent also some muskets, although few and poor ones. In what pertained to the captives,
he said that he would surrender those that he had, but that he could not persuade his datos to give up theirs; still he would
ask them to give their captives. At most, he sent eleven Christian captives, counting men, women, and children. He had already
spent the holy vessels, for, since it was so long a time since they had been brought, he had sold them to the king of Macazar;
but he said that he and all his property were there, to satisfy the Spaniards for any injury that they had received. The king
petitioned his Lordship to allow him to visit him; and his Lordship granted such permission for Quasimodo Sunday.

</p>
<p>The dattos [<i>sic</i>] were very angry that the king was so liberal, and because he humbled himself so deeply; accordingly, they opposed his leaving
the hill to talk with the governor. They tried to prevent it, but the king overruled everything by the reasons which he gave
to the datos, and which Father Gregorio Belin gave to him. His Lordship gave hostages for the king, and ordered Captain Marquez
and Captain Raphael Ome to remain as such. They asked for Admiral Don Pedro de Almonte and two fathers, but that was not granted
to them. Finally they were satisfied with the two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>said captains, persons of great esteem and worth; and the king came down to talk with his Lordship, accompanied by many chief
men. His Lordship received him with such display as he could arrange at short notice, under a canopy of damask, and seated
on a velvet chair, with a cushion of the same at his feet. Another cushion was placed at his side upon a rug. As the king
entered the hall, his Lordship rose from his seat, and advancing two steps, embraced the Moro king; then he made him sit down
on the cushion that had been prepared. Then his Lordship also seated himself beside the king in his chair, while at his right
side was his confessor, and at his left stood a captain of the guard and the sargento-mayor. Grouped behind the confessor
were the fathers who were in the quarters on that occasion. There were two Augustinian Recollects, and one Franciscan Recollect,
and a secular priest. Then came Father Gutierrez, and Father Gregorio Belin. The king requested permission to rest a little
first, for he came, one of his servants fanning him [<i lang="es">haciendole paypay</i>], lifting up from time to time the <i>chinina</i> which he wore&#8212;open in front, in order to catch the breeze, and to enable him to shelter himself from the heat, or to get
rid of the fears with which he had come. His chief men seated themselves after him on that open floor, a seat very suitable
for such nobility, who esteemed it as a great favor. Then when the king was rested, or reassured from his fears, they began
their discourses or <i>bicharas</i>, talking, after the manner of these people, by the medium of interpreters&#8212;namely, Father Juan de Sant Joseph, an Augustinian
Recollect, and Alf&eacute;rez Mathias de Marmolejo, both good interpreters. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>The governor set forth his conditions. The agreement made was: first, that the banners of the king our sovereign were to be
hoisted on the stronghold; second, that the men from Vasilan were to be permitted to leave the stronghold and go to their
country; third, that the Macazars and Malays were also to leave and return to their own lands; and fourth, in order that the
first condition might be fulfilled without the rattle of arms and the shedding of blood, all the enemy were to come down to
our quarters, while the king and queen and their family could come to that of the governor. The Moro king did not like this
last point; but as he saw that matters were ill disposed for his defense, he had to assent to everything. But, before its
execution, he begged his Lordship to communicate the terms with his men and datos, saying that he would endeavor to get them
all to agree to the fulfilment of what his Lordship ordered; and that in a day and a half he would reply and, in what pertained
to the other conditions, they would be immediately executed. This happened, for the Basillans descended in two days with all
their men and families&#8212;in all, one hundred and forty-seven. Some fifty or sixty did not then descend, as they were unable
to do so. The Macazars refused to descend until they received pardon from his Lordship, and a passport to their own country.
Therefore their captain came to talk with his Lordship, who discussed with him what was to be done with him and his men. The
latter are very humble and compliant to whatever his Lordship should order. His Lordship answered that he would pardon their
insolent and evil actions, and they could descend with security of life; and that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>would give them boats, so that they could go away. Thereupon the captain, giving a kris<a class="noteref" id="xd0e818src" href="#xd0e818">9</a> as security that they would come, returned, and immediately began to bring down his property and men. The Malays came with
them, for all those peoples had united against the Castilians. They are the ones who have done us most harm with their firearms,
and have furnished quantities of ammunition for all the firearms of the Joloans. At the end of the time assigned to the king
for answering his Lordship in regard to the matters which he had discussed with him, he was summoned, in order that what had
been recently concluded might not be hindered, as his Lordship had many matters to which to attend. If he would not come,
his Lordship was resolved immediately to continue his bombardment and fortifications, saying that he would make slaves of
all whom he captured. With this resolution, the queen determined to come to visit his Lordship; and, so saying and doing,
she summoned her chair, and had herself carried down to the quarters of Don Pedro de Almonte&#8212;which is the one located on their
hill, and which has given them so much to do. She sent a message to the governor, begging him to grant her permission, as
she wished to see him. His Lordship sent a message to her, to the effect that he would be very glad to see her, and that she
would be coming at a seasonable time. She came to the hall borne on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>the shoulders of her men, accompanied by some of her ladies and by her <i>casis</i>, who was coming with pale face. She alighted at the door of his Lordship&#8217;s hall. He went out to receive her, and with marked
indications of friendship and kindness led her to her seat, which was a cushion of purple velvet; and his Lordship, seated
in his own chair, welcomed her through his interpreter, Alf&eacute;rez Mathias de Marmolexo. She responded very courteously to the
courtesies of the governor; for the Moro woman is very intelligent, and of great capacity. She did not speak directly to the
interpreters, but through two of her men, one of whom was the <i>casis</i>; and often he, without the queen speaking, answered to what was proposed. The queen petitioned and entreated the governor
to desist from entering the stronghold, for the women, being timid creatures, feared the soldiers greatly. And if his Lordship
was doing it to oblige her and the king her husband to descend, she said that they would descend immediately, with all their
people. Thus did she entreat from him whom his Lordship represented; and I desired that she should obtain this favor. His
Lordship answered her that he would do so very willingly; but that he had an express mandate for it [<i>i.e.</i>, to gain the fort] from his king, and that, if he did not obey it, he would lose his head. &#8220;I do not wish,&#8221; said Toambaloca
(for such is the name of the queen), &#8220;that the favor which I petition be at so great a price and danger to your Lordship.
Consequently, will you kindly grant me three days? and in that time I, the king, and our people will descend without fail.&#8221;
His Lordship thanked her anew, and added that with this she obliged him to fulfil strictly what he had promised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>her. &#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said the queen, &#8220;I have no doubt of it; for, being in the gaze of so many nations that your Lordship has to
conquer, it is clear that you must fulfil what you have promised me; for your Lordship&#8217;s actions toward me would be understood
by all to be those that you would have to perform toward all.&#8221; This terminated the discussion. His Lordship ordered a collation
to be spread for the queen and her ladies; and then his Lordship retired, so that they might refresh themselves without any
embarrassment. Then, having dined, the queen returned to her stronghold with the retinue that she had brought. Before she
left the quarters she was saluted by the discharge of two large pieces of artillery, which had been made ready for that purpose.
She was greatly pleased by that, and the next day began to carry out her promises, by sending down a portion of her possessions.
The Macasars and Malays also brought down their property with hers, and immediately embarked. I had written up to this point
to this day, Saturday, the seventeenth of this month of April, hoping for the end of all these incipient results and expected
events regarding this stronghold; the issue has been such as we could expect from Him who has also been pleased to arrange
and bring it to pass. Last night the queen came down to sleep in our camp or quarters, with some of her ladies. In the morning
she went to report her good treatment to her people; for she was received with a salute of musketry and large artillery, and
a fine repast. All that has been done to oblige her to encourage her people, for they were very fearful, to descend immediately.
More than two thousand have now descended, and our banners <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>are flying on the hill, and our men are fortified on it. May God be praised, to whom be a thousand thanks given; for He, without
our knowledge or our expectations, has disposed this matter thus&#8212;blinding this Moro and disheartening him, so that, having
been defeated, he should surrender to our governor, and give himself up without more bloodshed. We are trying to secure Dato
Ache; if we succeed in this, I shall advise you. Now there is nothing more to say, reverend Father, except to give God the
thanks, for He is the one who has prepared and given this victory to us; and to beg all in your Reverence&#8217;s holy college to
give thanks that the college has had (as I am very certain) so great a share in the achievements [here]. The governor is very
much pleased, and we all regard him in the proper light. The men are full of courage, and even what was carefully done is
now improved. I am your Reverence&#8217;s humble servant, whom I pray that God may preserve as I desire, and to whose sacrifices
I earnestly commend myself. Jolo, April 17, 1638.

</p>
<p>All the Joloans descended, in number about four thousand six hundred, to the sea. Finding themselves down and outside the
enclosure, they all fled, under cover of a very heavy shower of rain&#8212;leaving all their possessions, in order not to be hindered
in their flight. Many mothers even abandoned their little children. One abandoned to us a little girl who had received a dagger-stroke,
who received the waters of baptism and immediately died. There is much to say about this, and many thanks to give to God,
of which we shall speak when it pleases God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>to let us see each other. Today, the nineteenth of this month of April, 1638.

<span class="smallcaps">Barrios</span>


</p>
<p>The governor sent messages to the king and queen by two <i>casis</i>, asking why they had fled. They replied that since all their people had fled, they had gone after them for very shame, but
that they would try to bring them back and to come, and this was the end of the matter. The result was exceedingly profitable
for our soldiers and Indians; for the Joloans, fearful because they thought that, if they became scattered, they would all
be killed, abandoned whatever they were carrying&#8212;quantities of goods, and chests of drawers&#8212;which our soldiers sacked. Above,
in the stronghold, they found much plunder. It is believed that the king and queen will return, but not Dato A&ccedil;he; but this
is not considered certain.

<p><i>Letter from Sanboangan</i>

</p>
<p><i>Pax Christi</i>


</p>
<p>I am not writing to anyone [else], for the lack of time does not allow me to do so. Therefore will your Reverence please communicate
this to the father provincial, Father Hernandez Perez; Father Juan de Bueras, and the father rector of Cavite.

</p>
<p>When our men were most disheartened at seeing that the fortress on the hill was so extensive, and that it was becoming stronger
daily; that the mines and artillery had seemingly made no impression on it; that we had been repulsed four times; and that
our men were falling sick very rapidly: in order that it might be very evident that it was [all] the work <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>of God, ambassadors came from the hill to beg his Lordship for mercy. He received them gladly, and asked them for the artillery
that they had plundered from the Christians, etc. They brought down four pieces, which they had taken from the shipyard, and
brought to us some Christians. Next day, more than one hundred and fifty people from Basilan descended, who surrendered their
arms, and then about fifty Macazars, who did the same; and all were embarked in the patache<span class="corr" id="xd0e871" title="Not in source">.</span>

</p>
<p>Next day the king and queen went down and slept in the camp of Don Sebastian. On the following day (which was the day agreed
upon when all were to descend from the hill), seeing that it was already late, the king and queen said that they would go
to get their people. The governor granted them permission, and went to a camp that was located opposite the gate of the stronghold.
All the Joloans descended, carrying their goods, arms, etc., to the number of about four hundred soldiers, and more than one
thousand five hundred women, children, old men, etc. They reached the governor&#8217;s camp and Don Pedro de Francia told the king
that they must surrender their arms. The latter replied that he would surrender them to none other than to the governor. Thereupon,
they went to summon his Lordship; but the Joloans, seeing that they were going to summon him, fled, under a heavy shower that
was falling, and abandoned all their goods. A vast amount of riches, many pieces of artillery, and versos, falcons, muskets,
arquebuses, etc., were found. The cause of the Moros fleeing was their great fear that they were to be killed. On our part,
since Don Sebastian Hurtado held all their stronghold, and had left only thirty men in his quarters (in order that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>Dato Ache might not escape), and as that number could not resist so many people, the Joloans were, on the contrary, allowed
to go without any firearms being discharged.

</p>
<p>More than two hundred and fifty of the Joloans have died, and they were perishing in great numbers from dysentery because
the women and children were placed under ground for fear of the balls. That and the fear of the mines caused their surrender;
for it was impossible to take their fort by assault. The interior strength of that stronghold is so great that the Spaniards
were surprised; and all recognize that it has been totally the work of God, and [a result of] the perseverance of Don Sebastian,
who ever said that all must die or capture the stronghold. Somewhat more than two hundred Christians and more than one hundred
Moro women have come from the stronghold during this time. All the Moro women are fearful. Up to date eighty-three Spaniards
have died from wounds, and many of them from disease.

<p>I shall not name others, as they are not so well known, and it will be known later. Up to date about two hundred Bisayan Indians
have died, most of them from diseases. Don Pedro Cotoan died while en route from Jolo to Sanboangan, in order to take back
the Bisayans, who are a most cowardly race. Those who have done deeds of valor are the Caragas, and the Joloans tremble at
sight of them. Don Pedro Almonte remains as governor and lieutenant for the captain-general at Sanboangan, with one hundred
and fifty Spaniards, as has been reported. Captain Jines Ros is to stay as castellan in Jolo with one hundred and eighty men&#8212;Captain
Sarria being fortified in the stronghold with eighty men, and Jines Ros on the beach in a stone tower that is already eight
stones high, with one hundred men. Captain Marquez is going to Buaren with fifty Spaniards, although no succor had been sent
to Don Sebastian from Manila. All that has been supplied to excess is truly wonderful, for the winds have brought (and it
is incredible) many champans, with more than twenty thousand baskets of rice, innumerable fowls, and pork, veal, beef, and
cheeses from Zebu, which have made a very excellent provision.

not know to what to compare these Moros of Samboangan. They have paid all their tributes. This is a brief relation. I pray
your Reverence to pardon me and commend me to God, for indeed what I desire is necessary. Sanboangan, April 23, 1638.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e939src" href="#xd0e939">11</a>

of the &#8220;sultan&#8221;), on the southern shore, hardly a trace remains; the present town of that name was built by the Spaniards
in 1878, and is modern in style. See <i>U. S. Gazetteer of Philippines</i>, pp. 842&#8211;850.

<p>[The following laws governing religious in the Philippines are taken from <i>Recopilaci&oacute;n leyes de Indias</i>, lib. i, tit. xiv.]

</p>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1030">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXX</h3>
<p>Inasmuch as some of the religious who minister in the Filipinas Islands are accustomed to go to China without the proper orders,
leaving the missions which are in their charge, whence follow many troubles and losses to what has been commenced and established
in the instruction and education of the Indians because of the lack that they occasion, we charge the superiors of the regulars
in the Filipinas Islands not to allow any of the religious of their orders to go to China, or to abandon the missions in their
charge, without the special permission and order of the governor and archbishop, which shall expressly state that such religious
is not going in violation of this law; and great care and vigilance shall be exercised in this. Further, we order that the
religious who shall go to the said islands at our cost, and who are assigned to live there permanently, shall not go nor shall
they be permitted to go to the mainland of China, or to other places, without permission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>from the governors and archbishops, since we send them to fulfil our obligation to impart instruction to our vassals. No lay
Spaniard shall give them a fragata or ship&#8217;s supplies without our special order, or the permission of the governors and archbishops,
notwithstanding any privileges that they may urge.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1037src" href="#xd0e1037">1</a> [Felipe II&#8212;Barcelona, June 8, 1585; Toledo, May 25, 1596; Felipe IV&#8212;in the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1046">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXV</h3>
<p>We order our viceroys of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to give license for the preaching of the holy gospel, the conversion and instruction
of the natives, and for everything else that is usual, to the discalced Carmelite religious whom their order shall send from
M&eacute;jico for that purpose to the Filipinas Islands, Nuevo-M&eacute;jico, and other parts; and in order that those religious may be
encouraged and incited to serve our Lord in that apostolic labor, the viceroys shall protect and aid them as far as possible.
[Felipe II&#8212;Madrid, June 9, 1585.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1051">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXV</h3>
<p>We charge the provincials, priors, guardians, and other superiors of these our kingdoms and of those of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a not to
prevent or obstruct the voyage of the religious who, after receiving our permission, undertake to go, together with their
commissaries, to engage in the conversion and instruction of the natives of the Filipinas Islands. Rather shall they give
those religious the protection and aid that is fitting. [Felipe II&#8212;Monzon, September 5, 1585.]

</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1057">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXIX</h3>
<p>In consideration of the expenses incurred by our royal estate in the passage of religious to the Filipinas Islands, of the
need [for religious] caused by those who return, and of the place that they occupy on the ships, and the fact that some persuade
others not to go to those parts, we order our governors of the said islands to meet with the archbishop whenever any religious
shall be about to leave those islands for these kingdoms or for other parts; and, after conferring with him, they shall not
grant those religious permission to leave the islands except after careful deliberation and for very sufficient reasons. [Felipe
II&#8212;San Lorenzo, August 9, 1589; Felipe III&#8212;Madrid, June 4, 1620.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1062">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXVII</h3>
<p>We order our viceroys and governors of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and charge the superiors of the orders&#8212;each one so far as he is concerned&#8212;to
see to it with all diligence and special care that the religious sent to the Filipinas Islands pass thither without being
detained. They shall not be allowed in other provinces, nor shall any excuse be accepted. [Felipe II&#8212;Aranjuez, April 27, 1594;
Felipe III&#8212;San Lorenzo, September 17, 1611.]

</p>
<p>[The following law taken from t&iacute;tulo xv of this same libro is here inserted.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1069">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXIII</h3>
<p>Inasmuch as we have been informed that the religious sent on our account to the Filipinas Islands for new spiritual conquests
will accomplish greater results if each order is set apart by itself, we order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>the governor and captain-general, and charge the archbishop, that when this circumstance occurs, and for the present, together
they divide, for the instruction and conversion of the natives, the provinces in their charge among the religious of the orders,
in such manner that there shall be no Franciscans where there are Augustinians, nor religious of the Society where there are
Dominicans. Thus each order shall be assigned its respective province, and that of the Society shall charge itself with the
[care of] missions; for it is under this obligation that they are to remain in those provinces, as do the other orders, and
in no other manner. [Felipe II&#8212;Aranjuez, April 27, 1594.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1076">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXIV</h3>
<p>The Audiencia of Manila shall give what is needful in ships, ship-stores, vestments, and the other customary supplies, to
the religious who shall have license and permission to enter China or Japon, according to the ordinances. Our officials of
those islands shall execute and pay for what the presidents and auditors shall order and authorize for that purpose. [Felipe
II&#8212;El Pardo, November 30, 1595.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1081">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXI</h3>
<p>It is fitting for the service of God our Lord and our own that, when any religious are to go to preach and teach the holy
Catholic faith to the heathen who live in the kingdoms of China, Japon, and other places, they shall not enter the country
of those barbarians in such a way that the result that we desire should not be obtained. Therefore we declare and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>order that no one of the religious who live in the Filipinas Islands be allowed to go to the kingdoms of China and Japon,
even though with the purpose of preaching and teaching the holy Catholic faith, unless he should have permission for it from
the governor of Filipinas. Whenever there is a question of sending religious to China or Japon, or permission is asked for
it, our president and auditors of the royal Audiencia of Manila shall meet in special session with the archbishop and the
provincials of all the orders of the Filipinas, and they shall consult over and discuss the advisable measures for the direction
of that holy and pious intent. They shall not allow any religious to go to the kingdoms of infidels without a previous permission
of the archbishop and governor, with the assent of all who shall be at the meeting. In order that this may be done, our president
and Audiencia shall give and cause to be executed all the orders that may be necessary. Such is our will. [Felipe II&#8212;Madrid,
February 5, 1596; Felipe IV&#8212;Madrid, December 31, 1621; February 16, 1635; November 6, 1636; September 2, 1638; July 12, 1640;

<h3 class="normal">Law XXVI</h3>
<p>Our viceroys of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a shall protect the religious who go to the Filipinas Islands by our order and at our account;
and the officials of our royal estate and all our other employees shall give them speedy despatch and shall treat them well.
They shall collect no duty for their persons, their books, and the warrants which are given them on which to collect the cost
of the voyage. [Felipe III&#8212;Madrid, September 18, 1609.]

</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1097">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXII</h3>
<p>His Holiness, Paul V, promulgated a brief at our request, dated Roma, June eleven, one thousand six hundred and eight, in
order that the religious of the orders of St. Dominic, St. Francis, and St. Augustine may go to Japon to preach the holy gospel,
not only by way of the kingdom of Portugal, but by way of any other country; and it is advisable for the service of God our
Lord that that brief be duly fulfilled. We order our viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and the governor of the Filipinas Islands, and
charge the prelates of the islands, to cause it to be obeyed and fulfilled, with the conditions and licenses ordained by the
laws of this t&iacute;tulo. [Felipe III&#8212;Madrid, February 8, 1610; Felipe IV&#8212;in the <i>Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1105">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXVIII</h3>
<p>We order our governor and captain-general of the Filipinas Islands that if there are any religious there who live in great
scandal, and not according to their rules, habit, and profession, and others who have been expelled from their orders, whom
the provincials cannot drive from that province because of the difficulty of embarking them for M&eacute;gico, that he hasten to
remedy this, as is necessary and as is most fitting to the service of God, our Lord, so that such religious may not remain
in those parts.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1110src" href="#xd0e1110">2</a> [Felipe III&#8212;San Lorenzo, September 17, 1616.]

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1117">
<h3 class="normal">Law LII</h3>
<p>Inasmuch as briefs have been despatched by his Holiness, ordering the religious of the Order of St. Augustine in some of the
provinces of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to elect in one chapter some of the Spanish religious who reside there, and in the next chapter
religious born in the Indias, we ask and charge the superiors and chapters of the said order to observe the said briefs and
cause them to be observed, in the form ordered by his Holiness&#8212;both in the provinces of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and in the Filipinas&#8212;since
they have passed before our royal Council, and testimony has been given of their presentation. The same is to be understood
in regard to the other orders and provinces of the Indias, which shall possess briefs for the <i>alternativa</i>, and under the same conditions. [Felipe IV&#8212;Madrid, September 28, 1629; August 1, 1633; and in the <i>Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1128">
<h3 class="normal">Law XXXIII</h3>
<p>Although it was determined that no religious except those of the Society of Jesus should go to Japon to preach the holy gospel
for the space of fifteen years, and that the others who should try to go to those parts through the rules of their order or
their particular devotion should be assigned the district to which they were to go, not permitting them to pursue their voyage
by way of Filipinas or any other part of the Western Indias, but by way of Eastern India&#8212;notwithstanding that the precept
for the propagation and preaching of the gospel is common to all the faithful, and especially charged upon the religious&#8212;we
consider it fitting that the missions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>and entrances of Japon be not limited to only the religious of the Society of Jesus; but that the religious go and enter from
all the orders as best they can, and especially from the orders that possess convents and have been permitted to go to and
settle in our Western Indias. There shall be no innovation in regard to the orders that are prohibited by laws and ordinances
of the Indias. Those laws are made not only for Eastern India but also for the Western Indias, in whose demarcation fall Japon
and the Filipinas. It is easier and better for the religious of our crown of Castilla to make their entrances by way of the
Western Indias. We straitly charge those who thus enter, from either direction, to maintain the greatest harmony and concord
with one another, and to regulate the catechism and method of teaching&#8212;so that, since the faith and religion that they preach
is one and the same thing, their teaching, zeal, and purpose may be so likewise. They shall aid one another in so holy and
praiseworthy an object, as if all lived under and professed the same rule and observance. If the nature of the country and
the progress in the conversion of its natives permit, the orders shall be divided into provinces, making the assignment of
those provinces as shall appear best, so that, if possible, the religious of the various orders shall not mingle. If any of
those religious who shall have been chosen are removed, others shall be assigned in their place, so that, as workers of the
holy gospel, they shall labor in this work which is so to the service of God our Lord, each order separately. They shall not
engage in quarrels or disputes, shall furnish a thoroughly good example, and shall avoid strictly all manner of trade, business,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>commerce, and all else that shows or discloses a taint or appearance of greed for temporal goods. And since it will be necessary,
in the further establishment and increase of the conversion in those provinces, to have therein three or four bishops, or
more, from all the orders&#8212;in order that they may confirm, preach, ordain priests, meet whenever advisable, and discuss and
enact what they think will be necessary to facilitate, augment, and secure for the conversion&#8212;they shall be suffragan, in
so far as it concerns them, to the archbishopric of Manila, because of the nearness and authority of that church. That division
of districts and dioceses shall be made by our Council of the Indias. [Felipe IV&#8212;Madrid, February 22, 1632.]

</p>
<p>[A later part of this law is as follows:]

</p>
<p>Further, we order our viceroys, presidents, governors, and corregidors to publish and execute the brief of our holy father,
Clement Ninth, dated June seventeen, one thousand six hundred and sixty-nine, ordering that the religious of all the orders
and the Society of Jesus, and the secular clerics, shall not be authorized to carry on, personally or through third parties,
trade or commerce throughout the territories of the Indias, or the islands or mainland of the Ocean Sea. In that number are
included those who go to Japon, as is mentioned in the said brief to which we refer. [Carlos II and the queen mother&#8212;Madrid,
June 22, 1670.]

</p>
<p>[The following laws bearing on ecclesiastical persons in the Philippines are taken from other parts of the <i>Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>:]

</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the seculars who go to the Filipinas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>Islands from Eastern India to engage in their labors are generally expelled and exiled, and remain there, where many are employed
in vicariates, curacies, and benefices, to the prejudice of the natives and the patrimonial rights of the islands, we order
our governor and captain-general not to allow any of the said seculars from those districts to enter the islands, or admit
them to the exercise of duties or allow them to give instruction. [Lib. i, tit. xii, ley xxi; Felipe IV&#8212;Madrid, March 27,
1631.]

</p>
<p>The treasurer of the Holy Crusade of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a has a substitute in the city of Manila, in the Filipinas Islands, who performs
the duties of treasurer. That substitute invests the money that proceeds from the bulls and many other sums, under pretext
that they belong to the bulls, by which method he deprives the inhabitants of the city of the use and lading-space of four
toneladas which he occupies in each cargo. That is contrary to the rulings of various laws, by which favor is granted the
said city of the lading-space in the ships that are permitted, and not to any person of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a or Per&uacute;. We charge and
order the viceroys of the said Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to cause investigation of the sum resulting from the bulls distributed in the
Filipinas, and that, whatever it be, it remain in our royal treasury of the islands, and that so much less be sent to the
islands from our royal treasury of Mexico. The amount that is found to have entered into the treasury of the islands is to
be given to the treasurer of the Holy Crusade who resides in the City of M&eacute;jico. The money that shall be sent to these kingdoms
from the proceeds of the bulls shall be registered on account of it. The treasurer and his substitute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>shall not export or import merchandise to those islands, nor from them to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, the viceroys imposing the penalties
that they shall deem fit. We order the officials of our royal treasury of both places to observe, in the execution of this
law, the ordinances which the viceroy [of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a] and the governor of the islands (each in his own district) shall ordain.
We order the governor to cause this law to be so obeyed that the sum resulting from the bulls be given into the possession
of the royal officials of those islands; and that they advise those of M&eacute;jico, so that the latter may send just so much less
a sum of money to the islands than what they are obliged to send there annually. [Lib. i, tit. xx, ley xxiv; Felipe IV&#8212;San
Martin, December 21, 1634.]

<p><i>List of the number of religious, colleges, houses, and residences of the province of the Society of Jesus; and of the churches,
districts, and missions of Indians administered in these Filipinas Islands, this present year, M.DC.LVI.</i>


</p>
<p>The following list of the religious, houses, colleges, and residences contained in this province at present, and of the districts,
and ministers for Indians and other nations who are under its direction, was made in obedience to an order from his Majesty
(may God preserve him). It gives the amount of the incomes and properties that they possess, and the number of Indians instructed.
I have deemed it fitting to add it here, so that the readers of this history may thus he informed of the present condition
of this province.


</p>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1169">
<h3 class="normal">Religious</h3>
<p>The religious of the Society who have come to these islands from Espa&ntilde;a and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a at the expense of his Majesty since
the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-one, the time of the arrival of the first, are in all two hundred and seventy-two.

</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty-one of these were priests, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>one hundred and ninety-eight, student brothers, and twenty-three, coadjutors.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1178src" href="#xd0e1178">1</a>

</p>
<p>During the seventy-five years since the Society entered these islands, one hundred and forty-three have been received and
have persevered in this province. Only three were priests; twenty-three were student brothers, and the rest coadjutors.

</p>
<p>The number at present in the province is one hundred and eight: seventy-four priests, eleven student brothers, and twenty-three
coadjutors.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1185">
<h3 class="normal">Colleges and houses</h3>
<p>The aforesaid one hundred and eight religious are distributed among five colleges, one novitiate house, one seminary-college
for secular collegiates, and nine residences, or rectoral houses, with their missions&#8212;a total of sixteen.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1190">
<h3 class="normal">Churches and villages</h3>
<p>The churches and villages in charge of the rectors of the said colleges and rectoral houses, and their missions, are seventy-three
in number, besides others which are being temporarily conducted in other parts, where there is no established village, although
the minister and instructor in doctrine visits them.

</p>
<p>The plan and distribution of these religious, colleges, houses, missions, villages, and churches, is as follows.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1197">
<h3 class="normal">The island of Manila and the Tag&aacute;l province College of San Ignacio of the city of Manila</h3>
<p>It has generally about thirty religious&#8212;priests, students, coadjutors, and novitiates. It is the seminary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>of all the branches of learning, where the subjects of reading, writing, and arithmetic are taught, the humanities, arts,
and theology; and has authority to confer degrees in arts and theology. It is the common infirmary and hospitium for the entire
province, especially for those who come new from the kingdoms of Espa&ntilde;a, and even from Eastern India, Terrenate, China, and
Japon&#8212;whence more than forty exiled religious came one year, whom this college received as guests and maintained for a long
time. The congregations or chapters of the province are held in it. It has those who take care of the sick and dying; preachers;
and confessors to the Spaniards, Indians, negroes, and other nations&#8212;who come to those ministers throughout the year, especially
during Lent, when some days eight or ten religious go out to preach in various parts. This college recognizes as its founder
and patron Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, former governor of Mindanao, who endowed it with one thousand pesos income
in certain house-properties and fruit-grounds, most of which have been lost with the lapse of time and the precarious character
of incomes in these regions. It is at present maintained by alms, and by other new lands and properties which it has been
recently acquiring, from which, although great diligence and care is exercised, the full amount necessary for its maintenance
is not derived&#8212;a matter of five or six thousand pesos&#8212;and consequently debt is incurred every year.

</p>
<p>The old church and house fell, and it has been necessary to build another and new one, stronger and more comfortable. For
that purpose his Majesty (may God preserve him) gave us an alms, in the year <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>one thousand six hundred and twenty-five, of ten thousand ducados in vacant allotments of Indians. That was carried into effect
by Governor Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora. Later, he ordered that six thousand more be given to us, which is still to be carried
into effect. Until the time of Governor Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, this college also enjoyed four hundred pesos and
four hundred fanegas of cleaned rice, which his Majesty ordered to be given for the support of four priests, who were to work
among the Indians, which was a great help. Although his Majesty in his piety and magnanimity orders it to be continued, the
needs of the royal treasury do not allow this to be done in its entirety.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1208">
<h3 class="normal">College and seminary of San Joseph</h3>
<p>This is for secular collegiates, theologians, artists, seminarists, rhetoricians, and grammarians. Formerly, their number
was thirty-five or forty; but now it has diminished to twenty or thereabout, because of the poverty of this country. It has
a rector, two professors of the Society, and two brother-coadjutors, who attend to its temporal affairs. Its patron is the
same Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa. Its income does not reach one thousand pesos, and that sum is used for the support
of the religious, and for repairs in the building and to the properties. The fellowships that the college obtains are maintained
with the sum remaining. The rest of the students pay one hundred pesos per year for their tuition. Inasmuch as the country
is poor, and most of the inhabitants are supported by the king&#8217;s pay, the fellowships are very few in number. For that reason,
Governor Don Sebastian Hurtado de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>Corcuera tried to endow some fellowships in the name of his Majesty, for the sons of his officials and for those of worthy
citizens. That was not continued, as it was done without order of the royal Council.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1215src" href="#xd0e1215">2</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1221">
<h3 class="normal">Mission village [doctrina] of Santa Cruz</h3>
<p>This is a village of Christian Chinese, opposite the Parian or alcaicer&iacute;a of the heathen of that nation on the other side
of the river of this city, and of some free negroes and Indians who work on the farm-lands of the college of Manila, to which
the above-mentioned mission village is subordinate. There are one or two priests who are interpreters in it. The number of
Chinese gathered in this mission village is five hundred tributarios, or a trifle less, and about one hundred Indians and
negroes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1226">
<h3 class="normal">Mission village [doctrina] of San Miguel</h3>
<p>This is a village of Tag&aacute;l Indians, and numbers about one hundred and forty tributarios. It has one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>priest who gives instruction. It is located outside the walls of the city of Manila, and is subordinate to the rector of that
college. A number of Japanese, comprising influential men and women who were exiled from their country for the faith, have
gathered in this village since the year fifteen. Among them, the illustrious gentlemen Don Justo Ucondono and Don Juan Tocuan,
with some influential women, have died with the lapse of time. The Society has always maintained all those Japanese with its
alms, and with the alms given by various persons who aided them generously when this city was in its prosperous condition;
but now they are living in penury. This house has been the seminary of martyrs since some of the European and Japanese fathers
have gone thence to Japon, who obtained there the glorious crown of martyrdom.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1233">

<p>It generally has four religious, three of whom are priests, who labor among the seamen and soldiers and the inhabitants of
that village&#8212;Spaniards, Indians, negroes, Chinese, Japanese, and people of other nationalities&#8212;and one brother, who attends
to temporal matters, and conducts the school for reading and writing. The mission of two small villages of Tag&aacute;l Indians near
there&#8212;namely, Cabite el Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, Old Cabite] and Binacaya, which have about one hundred and thirty tributarios&#8212;is subordinate to this college. The priests
who are generally asked by the governors for the fleets of galleons that oppose the Dutch, and those for the relief of Terrenate,
are sent from this college and the one at Manila. Its founder and patron is Licentiate Lucas de Castro, who endowed it with
an income of five hundred pesos, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>greater part of which was lost on the occasion of the rising of the Chinese in the year 39.

<h3 class="normal">Leyte</h3>
<p>This island has a circumference of about one hundred leguas, and is long and narrow. A large chain of mountains cuts it almost
in the middle. That and the difference of the two general monsoons, the brisas and the vendavals, cause there an inequality
and a wonderful variety of weather and climate, so that when it is winter in the north, it is summer in the south, and vice
versa during the other half of the year. Consequently, when the sowing is being done in one half of the island, the harvest
is being gathered in the other half. Hence they have two harvests per year, both of them plentiful; for ordinarily the seed
yields a hundredfold. Leyte is surrounded by many other small islands, both inhabited and desert. The sea and the rivers (which
abound, and are of considerable volume) are full of fish; while the land has cattle, tame and wild swine, and many deer and
fowls, with fruits, vegetables, and roots of all kinds. The climate is more refreshing than that of Manila. The people are
of a brownish color, and plain and simple, but of sufficient understanding. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>Their instruction and ministry is under charge of two residences or rectoral houses, namely, Carigara and Dagami.

are Carigara, Leyte, Xaro, Alangalang, Ogmuc, Bayban, Cabalian, Sogor, Poro, and Panahon, which are adjacent islets. The products
of the earth in which the natives pay their tribute are wax, rice, and textiles of abac&aacute;, which are here called medri&ntilde;aques
and pinayusas. Six religious are occupied in the instruction of those villages and districts, besides those who have charge
of the instruction in the shipyards for the galleons&#8212;which are generally built in this island and district on his Majesty&#8217;s
account, and because of the great ease in procuring lumber there, and the convenient ports. Two priests died gloriously in
this residence, one at the hands of Moro pirates,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1319src" href="#xd0e1319">6</a> and the other at the hands of the natives themselves in the district of Cabalian<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1325src" href="#xd0e1325">7</a>&#8212;who, being the natives farthest from the chief village, are less obedient and pacified than the others.

in the same things as those of Carigara, except the inhabitants of the village of Guiguan, whose products consist of palm-oil.
Opposite the village of Leyte in this island is another small island called Panamao, which has no people, but wild boars and
other kinds of game, besides excellent woods for shipbuilding. Some few years ago a mineral abounding in sulphur was discovered.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1338src" href="#xd0e1338">8</a>

<p>It has about one thousand six hundred tributarios, who are instructed by five religious. They are divided among eight principal
villages, to wit, Palapag, Catubig, Bobon, Catarman, Tubig, Bacor, Boronga, and Sulat. The natives pay their tributes in the
same products as those of Leytey, and, in addition to those, some years ago they produced a quantity of civet. The greater
part of this residence was in revolt some years ago, the authors of the revolt and insurrection having apostatized from the
faith. Two father rectors of the residence&#8212;very important religious&#8212;were killed in succession by them, giving up their lives
willingly in the exercise of their ministry.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1375src" href="#xd0e1375">10</a> Now the war which has been waged to reduce them has been concluded. The relief ships from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a have made port several

performed very important services for the king and for the community. The two islands are much infested with pirates and hostile
[Moros]&#8212;Mindanaos, Joloans, and Camucones&#8212;who take a great number of captives nearly every year. For that reason, and because
of their labor in the building of galleons, and the epidemics that afflict them at times, although fifty-five years ago, at
the beginning of the instruction by the Society, there were more than twenty thousand tributarios, now they do not exceed
six or seven thousand. When the Society took charge of these two islands, all their natives were heathen; but now, through
the goodness of God, they are all Christians.

<h3 class="normal">Island of Mindanao</h3>
<p>It is the largest island of the Filipinas, next to that of Manila. A great part of it is still unsubdued. In the portion that
is subdued, the Society has charge of the jurisdictions of Iligan and Samboangan. The latter is the principal presidio of
the Spaniards, where we are beginning to establish a college.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e1394">
<h3 class="normal">College of Samboangan</h3>
<p>This college has a rector, with five priests as workers. The villages that it instructs are those of the natives and Lutaos
of Samboangan itself, who number eight hundred families. Instead of paying tribute, they serve at the oar in our fleets, which
are generally out on raids in defense of our coasts and for the purpose of attacking those of the enemy. The island of Basilan,
opposite the presidio of Samboangan, and two leguas away, has about one hundred families&#8212;most of whom, attracted by the efforts,
affection, and solicitude of the missionary fathers, come to receive the sacraments. When the tribute is due, fewer of them
appear. The Christian kindness of the Spaniards, which is most concerned with the welfare of souls, passes that by, because
those people are not yet completely subdued and domesticated, and because of the risk of losing everything if they oppress
them too heavily. The same condition prevails not only in the mission on the island of Basilan, but also in all the other
missions of this jurisdiction of Samboangan. In the region of Mindanao these are: La Caldera, a port situated at a distance
of two leguas eastward from Samboangan, with about two hundred families; Bocot, two hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>and fifty; Piacan, and Sirauey, one hundred; Siocon, three hundred; Maslo, one hundred; Manican, thirty; Data, twenty-five;
Coroan, twenty; Bitale, forty; Tungauan, one hundred; Sanguito, one hundred; all lying south of Samboangan, and all giving
a total of three thousand two hundred and fifty-one families.

</p>
<p>In this jurisdiction are included also the islands of Pangotaran and Ubian, a three days&#8217; journey from Samboangan, whose inhabitants
are nearly all Christians. When the fleets pass that way, the natives give them some kind of tribute. <i>Item:</i> the islands of Tapul and Balonaguis, whose natives are still heathen. <i>Item:</i> there are many islets about Basilan, the shelter of fugitive Indians, many of whom are Christians&#8212;who come to the fathers,
at times, for the administration of the sacraments; and, at the persuasion of the latter, are mustered for service in the
fleets. The island of Jolo belongs also to the said jurisdiction of Samboangan. There are many Christians in that island,
who remained there when the Spanish presidio was removed. The father missionaries go to visit them at times, and endeavor
to bring them back for the administration of the holy sacraments. Reducing all those Indians to families, there are about
two hundred or so in Pangotar&aacute;n and Ubian: one hundred and fifty in Tapul and Balonaguis; two hundred in the islets of Basilan;
and five hundred in Jolo and its islets: in all one thousand families.

<h3 class="normal">Jurisdiction of Iligan, with its residence of Dapitan</h3>
<p>This jurisdiction extends through the eastern part of the island. Its district extends for sixty leguas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>which includes the nation of the Subanos,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1416src" href="#xd0e1416">11</a> which is the most numerous in the island, and well disposed toward the evangelical instruction, as they are heathen, and
not Mahometans as are the Mindanaos.

</p>
<p>The village of Iligan, which is the capital of the jurisdiction, and where its alcalde-mayor and infantry captain of the presidio
lives, has about one hundred tributarios on the shore; and in the interior, in another village called Baloy, there are about
two hundred families, although only thirty come to pay the tribute. In another village, called Lauayan, which is on the other
side of Iligan and on the bay of Panguil, fifty [families pay tribute], although there are twice as many. Then comes Dapitan,
which is the seat of the residence and mission, as the people there are the oldest Christians of these islands, who went willingly
to meet the first Spaniards who came to conquer them, and guided and served them during the conquest, and have always persevered
faithfully in their friendship. For that reason they are exempt from tribute. They number about two hundred families; while
there are about two hundred and fifty more families in another and interior village situated on the headwaters of the same
river.

</p>
<p>The villages situated on the coast in the direction of Samboangan are Dipoloc, with three hundred families; Duyno, with six
hundred; Manucan, with one hundred; Tubao, with one hundred; Sindagan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>with five hundred; Mucas, with two hundred; Quipit, with three hundred: with a total of one thousand seven hundred and fifty
families, who are computed to be included in this residence, whose instruction is generally in charge of five priests.

</p>
<p>Within a few years seven priests have given their lives and shed their blood in this island for the administration of the
holy gospel, at the hands of the Moros and apostates: two in the residence of Dapitan,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1436src" href="#xd0e1436">12</a> and five in the district of Samboangan. Of these, one was in Siao;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1445src" href="#xd0e1445">13</a> two in Buayen,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1454src" href="#xd0e1454">14</a> a kingdom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>of the Moros; and two others but recently in this current year of 1656, in the capital of the entire island&#8212;namely, the river
of Mindanao, in the settlement where King Corralat lives and holds his court.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1470src" href="#xd0e1470">15</a> There are, besides, other lathers who have been captives, one of whom died in captivity;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1485src" href="#xd0e1485">16</a> and others who have died in the Spanish presidio, at their posts as chaplains.

</p>
<p>The products of Mindanao and its islands are in general the same as those of the other islands&#8212;namely, rice, palms [<i>sc.</i>, cocoanuts], a quantity of wax, vegetables, civet, and wild cinnamon (which is used fresh). In the island of Jolo, a quantity
of amber has been found at times, and some large pearls. It alone of all the Filipinas Islands has elephants.

from the district of Dapitan, and others of our missions&#8212;have sailed during the last few years to this great island, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>since our fathers have always accompanied them and acted as their chaplains, a mission has been formed there at the same time;
and the ministries of the Society have been exercised in those so remote parts, with not a little gain, and great hopes of
numerous Christians, since those baptized number seven hundred&#8212;among whom are some of the chiefs of the neighboring islands,
who have already offered vassalage to the king our sovereign, and asked for ministers of the gospel. If God be pleased to
let our arms in Mindanao be free, and if this undertaking that has been begun in Borney be continued, it will be without doubt
to the great exaltation of our holy faith, and the advantage of the Spanish state in these Filipinas Islands. For, besides
freeing the islands from the continual invasions, fires, thefts, and captivities by those pirates, they will enjoy the fertility,
wealth, and abundance of this island, which is the largest one of these archipelagos, having a circumference of four hundred
and fifty leguas. It is the way-station for the commerce of the rich kingdoms of India <i lang="la">extra Gangem</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, beyond the Ganges], Pegu, Sian, and Camboxa, upon which it borders. In respect to Christianity, great increase can be promised;
for the people are, as a rule, docile and of good understanding. Although the faith of Mahomet has made some headway in the
maritime parts&#8212;but not with the obstinacy experienced in other islands&#8212;all the people of the interior are heathen.

<p>The Society maintains a college in the island of Terrenate, which is the head of the missions of that archipelago, which were
hitherto subject to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>[Jesuit] province of Cochin in Eastern India. Last year they were assigned to this province of Filipinas by virtue of a royal

of, the revolt of Portugal and India.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1519src" href="#xd0e1519">17</a> At present three priests are busied in this labor: one is the rector who lives in the house and college of Terrenate, to
look after the ministry of Spanish and Indians in the presidios of that island and that of Tidore, and the village of Mardicas.
The other two visit in mission the many stations in their charge, as long as there is no minister belonging to each of these.

</p>
<p>The chief and oldest mission is that of the kingdom of Siao, where there was estimated to be at the beginning, eleven thousand
seven hundred Christians, while today they do not number four thousand. The king of that place has many subjects, and allies
in the islands of Tabuco or Sanguil Bagar,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1524src" href="#xd0e1524">18</a> the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>Talaos,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1536src" href="#xd0e1536">19</a> and in Matheo or Macasar. The Talaos number about eleven thousand souls, and their chief is a Christian. So likewise those
of Maganita, Moade, Tomaco, and Sabugan in Sanguil Ba&ccedil;ar. There are eight hundred native Christians in Calonga, the capital
of the same island. A Franciscan priest lives there at present, while the Society, to whom that mission belongs, has no one
to send there.

</p>
<p>From Siao the mission of the province of Manados, in the island of Matheo or Macasar, is also visited. Formerly it had four
thousand Christians, but now Christianity is almost wiped out (even the villages of our faith, and allied to us) by the raids
of the Dutch and the Terrenatans, who favor another nation and one allied with the Dutch and Terrenatans. Inasmuch as the
land of Manados is unhealthful, five members of the Society have perished in the enterprise of its conversion. A short distance
from Manados is Cautipa, a part of the same mainland of Macasar, and subject to the king of Siao, with about four or five
thousand heathen families. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>The fathers lived among them and made some Christians formerly.

</p>
<p>The former Christian settlements in Gilolo&#8212;Sabugo, Moratay, San Juan de Tolo, and others of Batachina&#8212;which before numbered
two hundred and fifty thousand Christians, instructed by our fathers, are also destroyed by the same wars with heretics. May
the Lord bring it about that that door may be again opened to the cultivation of this vineyard, through the peace of Espa&ntilde;a
and Olanda. This vineyard is continued, by way of this district of Batachina, by the Papuans and thence by Nueva Guinea&#8212;whose
farthest bounds are yet unknown, as well as the knowledge of what God has reserved for the evangelical ministers and the Spanish

that it was aimed at their college of Santo Tom&aacute;s; while in Spain the king and his council were equally indignant because
they had not been previously consulted in the matter, an indignation that was carefully fostered and increased by the Dominicans.
The lawsuit in this case was bitter, and was conducted in the supreme Council of the Indias by Juan Grau y Monfalcon, procurator
of the cabildo of the city of Manila; Father Baltasar de Lagunilla, procurator-general of the Society of Jesus, for the college
of San Jos&eacute;; and father Fray Mateo de Villa, procurator-general of the Dominican province of the Rosario, for the college
of Santo Tom&aacute;s. The case was prolific in documents from all three sources. The Dominicans remained masters of the field, and
this case contributed to the downfall of Corcuera, who was finally superseded in 1644 by Diego de Fajardo, who had been appointed
some years before, but might never have gone to the islands had it not been for the lawsuit over the fellowships. See Pastells&#8217;s

called Tabaco), Maganitos, Tabucan, and Calonga. The latter had two villages, Calonga and Tarruma, where there was formerly
a presidio with ten or twelve Spanish soldiers, solely for the defense of those two Christian villages from the invasions
of the Moros of the same island. The village of Tarruma after the dismantling of our forts, passed into the control of the

<p>[This survey of religious affairs in the islands is taken from the <i lang="es">Chronicas</i> (Manila, 1738) of the Franciscan chronicler San Antonio, vol. i, pp. 172&#8211;175, 190&#8211;210, 214&#8211;216, 219, 220, 223&#8211;226.]

<div class="div2" id="xd0e1577">
<h3 class="label">Chapter XLVI</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Ecclesiastical theater of the Philipinas Islands</h3>
<p>510. Who does not express wonder that the evangelical preaching in these islands (and more especially at Manila) is so eloquent;
that the worship in the temples has a veneration as perennial as it is ceremonious; that the holy orders maintain themselves
in the most strict observance of their institutes and rules; that the Christian church is so happily increased; that devotion
is so well received; and that justice is so uprightly administered? For, if one considers without prejudice, these are certain
precious gems, so resplendent and so exquisite, that the crown of Espa&ntilde;a can glory in adorning itself with them&#8212;even though
it he, as is the fact, the Spaniards who shape those gems from justice. All this so ennobles these islands that they are reported
as extraordinary among all these lands.

</p>
<p>511. This ecclesiastical theater of the city of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>Manila demands huge tomes from justice for its history, which the limits of my history do not permit; and a very ingenious
pen for its praises, which is not united with my lack of eloquence. I have seen some voluminous writings on this subject,
which I have no time to follow. I have seen some that are written so meagerly, that my own interest [in the subject] is offended.
May it please God that my design, which confesses itself debtor to all, may now find a proper medium.

</p>
<p>512. The first church of Manila was erected as a parochial church, under the title of the Immaculate Conception of our Lady,
at the end of the year 1571, when the adelantado and conquistador, Legaspi, divided the lands and site of Manila. Although
I have read in a certain manuscript that that first erection was made with four clerics, I cannot find in history anything
that verifies this statement. For the printed histories of these islands state that when the adelantado Legaspi divided the
land, he summoned the natives of Manila and their ruler, Raja Matanda; and, placing the fathers of St. Augustine in their
presence, told them that those were their true fathers, and their instructors in the law of the true God, who had come to
teach it to them; and there is no mention of any secular.

</p>
<p>513. Further, I think that the licentiate Don Juan de Vivero was the first cleric who came to these islands. Although he came
hither in the year 1566, in the famous ship &#8220;San Geronymo,&#8221; five years before the conquest of Manila, it is not proved to
my satisfaction that he was ever in Manila; and it is more probable that he remained in Zebu, the first land that was conquered.
Another cleric was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>licentiate Don Juan de Villanueva, of whom the only thing known is that he was a priest, and that he lived but a little time&#8212;and
that after the erection of the church. Another cleric who came earlier [than the latter] was Don Luis Barruelo, who had been
sent to Philipinas by the archbishop of M&eacute;xico, as associate of the above-mentioned Don Juan de Vivero, so that they might
be the judge-provisors and vicars-general of all the islands; for the archbishop thought that this provision belonged to his
care and jurisdiction, as he was the prelate nearest to these islands. But Don Luis Barruelo arrived at the islands in the
year 1577, six years after the foundation of Manila. Therefore it appears that the Augustinian fathers were the only ones
who exercised the entire government <i>in utroque foro</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1597src" href="#xd0e1597">1</a> and the parochial administration of Manila and all the islands. To them succeeded, in the said government, the discalced
Franciscan religious, until the arrival of the most illustrious Salaz&agrave;r, first bishop of Manila.

</p>
<p>514. This church, when first erected, was poor. Although with the lapse of time it had sufficient incomes, yet, with the fires
and continual earthquakes, the church buildings were ruined. Thus, because of the earthquakes of the year 1645, the church
of La Misericordia was used as the cathedral church from November 26, 1652, until June 7, 1662, when possession was taken
of the new church. The latter is still standing, and was built by the zealous and costly efforts of the holy archbishop, Don
Miguel de Poblete, albeit he did not leave it entirely finished. His Excellency placed the first stone April 20, 1654. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>It was a square slab, and bore the following inscription: &#8220;The Church being under the government of Innocent X; the Espa&ntilde;as,
under King Phelipe IV the Great; and these islands, under Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, knight of the Order of Calatrava:
Don Miguel de Poblete, its metropolitan archbishop, placed this stone, April 20, 1654, for the building of this holy cathedral&#8212;its
titular being the Conception of our Lady, and its patron, St. Andrew the apostle.&#8221; It was completed later (on August 30, 1671),
by the dean his nephew, the master Don Joseph Millan de Poblete, who was afterward bishop of Nueva Segovia. It is a beautiful
stone building. It is forty brazas long by fifteen wide, and five high. It has three principal doors, corresponding to the
three naves of its structure. Along the two side aisles it has eight chapels on each side [of the church], with two sacristies&#8212;one
for Spaniards, and the other for the natives of this country. The capacity of its choir is fifty-two. Its stalls are of red
wood. The steeple is high and beautiful, and has fourteen bells&#8212;a larger number and larger in size than the old bells, and
lately cast anew&#8212;and has upper works of wood, which are not used. The church is under the personal care and watchful management
of the archbishop of Manila who is now governing. The houses of the ecclesiastical cabildo are contiguous to the church.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1609src" href="#xd0e1609">2</a>

</p>
<p>515. Gregory XIII was the one who erected that first parochial church into a cathedral, by his bull <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>given at Roma in the seventh year of his pontificate, namely, in that of 1578, at the petition of our Phelipe II, king of
the Espa&ntilde;as. He assigned it twenty-seven prebendaries of whom the king appoints those who are necessary. They consist of five
dignitaries&#8212;dean, archdeacon, precentor, schoolmaster, and treasurer; three canons (the fourth having been suppressed by the
Inquisition, as has been done throughout the Indias); and two whole and two half racioneros, by virtue of a royal decree given
in Valladolid, June 2, 1604, countersigned by Juan de Ybarra, the king&#8217;s secretary. With the above, and two curas, sacristans,
master-of-ceremonies, verger, etc., this church is very distinguished and well served, and the choir is quite crowded at all
canonical hours. At its first erection, the advocacy of the most pure Conception was bestowed upon this church, and it has
been preserved up to the present time.

</p>
<p>516. The archbishops of Manila receive the salary of 5,000 pesos of common gold, by virtue of his Majesty&#8217;s decree given at
Madrid, May 28, 1680; the dean, 600 pesos, by virtue of royal presentation; the four dignitaries of this holy church&#8212;namely,
archdeacon, schoolmaster, precentor, and treasurer&#8212;each receive 500 pesos, for the same reason; the three canons&#8212;namely, the
doctoral, the magistral, and he of grace&#8212;each 400 pesos, for the same reason; the two racioneros, each 300 pesos, for the
same reason; the two medio-racioneros, each 200 pesos, for the same reason; the master-of-ceremonies, 200 pesos, by a royal
decree dated February 22, 1724; the two curas of the holy church&#8212;one for the Spaniards, and the other for the natives and
blacks&#8212;each 183 pesos, 6 tomins, and 7 granos.

<p>537. For the despatch of its business this archiepiscopal ecclesiastical tribunal has its provisor and vicar-general, with
his chief notary and fiscals. It has a house which is used as the prison of the ecclesiastical tribunal, which has a capacious
living-room, and separate lodgings for the seclusion of abandoned women.


</p>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1636">
<h4>Commissariat of the holy Inquisition</h4>
<p>538. There has been and always is in this city of Manila a commissary of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, appointed by
the holy tribunal of M&eacute;xico.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1641src" href="#xd0e1641">3</a> That commissary is the superior and superintendent of all the commissaries scattered about in the islands&#8212;namely, in Cagay&agrave;n,
Pangasin&agrave;n, Camar&igrave;nes, Zeb&ugrave;, Il&ograve;cos, and the island of Negros; and at Manila another private commissary for the fathers of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>Society, who is always an honored cleric. The tribunal here is formed of the said superintendent-commissary with his chief
constable and his notary. Its council of ministers comprises various examiners of books and writings, counselors, and familiars.
There are always three or four superintendent-commissaries appointed, so that in case of death or removal another may succeed
promptly to the office; but only one of them exercises the office [at any one time]. From the time of the venerable martyr
of Syan [<i>i.e.</i>, Siam], Fray Juan de San Pedro Martyr, or Maldonado, the first commissary in these islands (who died December 22, 1599),
until the present commissary, the very reverend father ex-provincial Fray Juan de Arechederra (a son of the convent of San
Jacinto de Caracas, of the province of Santa Cruz of the Indias, and graduated with the degree of doctor from the celebrated
university of M&eacute;xico), this office of superintendent-commissary has been vested in the religious of our father St. Dominic
successively, without other interruption than the short interval of seven years&#8212;when an Augustinian, Father Joseph Paternina,
exercised the office, beginning with October, 1664, when he succeeded father Fray Francisco de Paula, until July of 1671.
Then father Fray Phelipe Pardo, afterward archbishop of Manila, assumed the office, because of the dismissal of Father Patern&igrave;na
from his office by a sentence of the holy tribunal of M&eacute;xico, because he unjustly issued acts against and arrested the governor
of these islands, Don Diego de Salcedo. This commissariat has always been a post of great honor, authority, and credit, and
is for that reason eagerly sought by the most distinguished members of the order. But, the tribunal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>of M&eacute;xico having requested the fathers superintendent-commissaries to make investigations, in order to act as such, the Dominican
fathers excused themselves, as they live here without incomes, and were unable to make investigations because of their increased
expenses; and Father Patern&igrave;na being in M&eacute;xico on that occasion, he easily obtained the office which afterward cost him so
much.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1656">
<h4>Tribunal of the Holy Crusade</h4>
<p>539. The erection of the apostolic and royal tribunal of the Holy Crusade in the city of Manila (as the capital of these islands,
where the royal Audiencia resides), had its foundation in the general decree of Phelipe III, given in San Lorenzo, under date
of May 16, 1609.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1661src" href="#xd0e1661">4</a> In consequence of that decree, that tribunal is composed of a commissary-subdelegate-general, who performs the duties of
president, and is appointed by his Majesty, with the advice of the supreme council of the Holy Crusade; an auditor, who is
the senior auditor of the royal Audiencia; and the fiscal of the same body&#8212;all of whom receive a special salary for their
duties. For the computation of its accounts, the senior accountant of the royal officials serves, in accordance with the terms
of the above-mentioned royal decree. For their business they have a secretary; a chief notary, with a salary; and four notaries,
without any assigned salary, but who receive the fees from the business transacted by them. For the expedition of the bulls
(which are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>published biennially in these provinces), the suitable number, and at all prices&#8212;bulls for the living and for the dead, <i>de lacticinios</i>, and of composition<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1675src" href="#xd0e1675">5</a>&#8212;are sent from Europa, with the bundles of despatches and instructions from his Majesty and from the apostolic commissary-general.
Having been first examined and numbered before the subdelegate-general, they are deposited under good security in the royal
magazines of this capital, where pay-warrants are issued for the treasurer-general or manager, into whose charge this business
is given.

</p>
<p>540. From the first foundation, it was established that the preaching of each biennial term should occur on the twenty-eighth
of October. But with the beginning of the year 1736 that date was transferred to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>first Sunday in Advent, by order of his Excellency the commissary-general, so that the preaching might be on the same date
in all the kingdoms and seigniories of the royal crown.

</p>
<p>541. The management and despatch of this concession, and the collection of the alms and proceeds from it, were regularly included,
annexed, in the agreements which were made with the royal apostolic tribunal of the City of M&eacute;xico&#8212;the treasurer-general of
the kingdom naming a substitute deputy, who should have in his charge the matters pertaining to these Philipinas. When that
was omitted, it was in charge of the royal officials of these treasuries, in accordance with the royal decrees which have
so provided it. Certain publications intervened, which were entrusted, by special arrangement, to the inhabitants of Manila,
independently of the treasurer-general of M&eacute;xico. But lately, the dependence of Philipinas on the arrangements of that kingdom
having been dispensed with, a solemn agreement was made with the royal apostolic tribunal of this capital, for the six biennials
of the thirteenth concession, by General Don Joseph Antonio Nu&ntilde;o de Villavicencio, proprietary regidor of this city (who obtained
a letter from his Excellency the bishop, an inquisitor, and former apostolic commissary-general of the said Holy Crusade);
and the said contract having terminated, a new one was made by General Don Diego Zamudio, an inhabitant of the said city,
who is charged with this enterprise for the six biennials of the current and fourteenth concession.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1710src" href="#xd0e1710">6</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>542. For that expedition the said treasurers give bonds in sufficient form. They appoint the receiving treasurers, who attend
to the expense of bulls in all the villages of the provinces that are included in this jurisdiction, and place the proceeds
of this concession, as they become due, in the royal treasury of Manila, or in those of M&eacute;xico, according to the agreement
at the time of contract.

<div class="div3" id="xd0e1724">
<h4>Royal chapel</h4>
<p>543. Inside the walls of the city of Manila, and at the extreme northeast by north section of it, stands the royal chapel,
which has the title of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Encarnacion [<i>i.e.</i>, our Lady of the Incarnation], and contains the most holy sacrament. It is a very elegant structure, and was founded by Governor
Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera. It is used for the chapel functions of the royal Audiencia, for the spiritual administration
of the royal hospital for the soldiers of the army, and for their burial. For this last purpose, the chaplains go without
any subordination to the parish church, wearing the cope, and with cross carried high, through the public streets to the said
royal hospital for the bodies of the deceased soldiers, which they carry with all manner of solemnity to the royal chapel,
where they are buried. For the above, and so that they may serve in the chaplaincies of the galleons in this line, and for
the divine worship of the said chapel, the chapel has its chief chaplain, and a number of royal chaplains, sacristans, and
other ministers, who serve it with great decorum and pomp. This is a rich <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>church, and is beautifully adorned with altars, reredoses, pulpit, and sacristy; it has choir, organ, and a goodly band of
singers; and rich ornaments, and sacred vessels of silver and gold&#8212;and, in particular, a monstrance of pure gold, valued at
eleven thousand ducados.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1734">
<h4>Royal hospital</h4>
<p>544. Not very far from this royal chapel, and more toward the center of the city, is the said royal hospital, for the soldiers
of the Manila camp. It has its own chaplain, manager, physician, surgeon, apothecary, and all the other necessary provisions.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1739">
<h4>Royal seminary-college of San Phelipe</h4>
<p>545. His Majesty asked Don Fausto Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora, governor of these islands, by a royal decree of November 28, 1697, to
inform him whether there was or was not a seminary-college for boys in Manila, for the service of his cathedral church; and
that, in case there were not, he should set about its foundation and building. He was to advise his Majesty of the expenses
necessary for it, and for its necessary maintenance. The governor reported; and, by another royal decree of April 28, 1702,
the piety of his Catholic Majesty decided upon the foundation of a royal college in the city of Manila, which should be a
seminary for eight seminarists. The sum necessary for its building and maintenance was to be appropriated from the funds accumulating
from vacancies in the bishoprics of these islands, and from the tithes; and, if necessary, from the funds of the royal treasury.
All was to be done with the advice of the archbishop of Manila, and his Majesty was to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>informed of all that was done. Everything was carried out by the governor and master-of-camp, Don Domingo de Zab&aacute;lburu; and,
with the approval of his Excellency the archbishop, Don Diego Camacho y Avila, the plans for the building of the seminary
were begun with all possible energy. By a general meeting of the treasury tribunal, held May 22, 1705, four thousand pesos
were appropriated to General Don Miguel de Elorriaga for the encouragement of this enterprise.

</p>
<p>546. With the arrival at these islands of the patriarch of Antiochia, Cardinal Don Carlos Thomas Millard de Tourn&ograve;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1748src" href="#xd0e1748">7</a> in the year 1704, and with the stay of the abbot Don Juan Baptista Sid&ograve;ti<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1760src" href="#xd0e1760">8</a> in the islands, until he went to Japon, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>work was strengthened by various alms, which the said Sid&ograve;ti went about collecting for it, until he succeeded in giving it
a stone foundation one vara high. The seminary was called San Clemente, in honor of the pope.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1779src" href="#xd0e1779">9</a> Then writing to Madrid and to Roma the progress that had been made&#8212;namely, that the seminary was already in operation, and
that the number of the seminarists exceeded twenty, and attributing that glory to the said gentlemen and to their efforts,
it was advised that the said cardinal should select those persons whom he thought proper for master and rector. Pontifical
commission was assigned him for that, and in fact, in the year 1707, the licentiate Don Gabriel de Ist&ugrave;ris was appointed rector,
and the bachelor Don Hyp&ograve;lito del Rio as master of the seminarists. On November 28 of that year, the first eight seminarists
were received by the governor of these islands, Don Domingo de Zab&aacute;lburu. The archbishop and governor of these islands helped
in all these plans, and, in addition to the above alms, contributions were made from the revenues of the royal treasury.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>547. Having been informed of all this news, the apostolic nuncio at the court of Espa&ntilde;a presented himself before the Catholic
Majesty in the name of the pope (who had been informed by the archbishop and the governor of Manila), asking that his Majesty
would deign to consider as valid the said foundation in the aforesaid form in the city of Manila&#8212;since it meant glory to his
crown to have a seminary in these islands, from which so many advantages would follow for the spread of the Catholic faith
in Japon, and China, and among other barbarous peoples, by rearing subjects in the said seminary in virtue and learning as
evangelical ministers, of whom there was so much need. That was to be without any expense to the royal treasury, since some
of its seminarists were supported with alms, and some with the revenues that belonged to their own houses.

</p>
<p>548. His Majesty consulted his royal Council of the Indias. From their examination of the matter a royal decree resulted,
dated at Madrid, March 3, 1710, and countersigned by his Majesty&#8217;s secretary, Don Felix de la Cruz Ah&egrave;do, and with the rubrics
of five members of the Council of the Indias. In it his Majesty manifests his just anger at such innovations and prejudicial
proceedings through the agency of foreigners, when his Majesty had ordained it so long beforehand; and that, with what had
been done, there should be given room for such progress to be attributed in the Roman court to the active diligence of foreigners,
when his Catholic zeal had sent, at the cost of his royal treasury, and maintained in these parts the great number of learned
regular missionaries [who are there] for the conversion [of the heathen], and the propagation of the holy gospel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>He was angry also because this news had come to his royal ears by other vehicles than his vassals and ministers, and that
foreigners had been allowed in these islands without his royal consent.

</p>
<p>549. Therefore, in the said royal order, his Majesty commands that all the foreign seminarists be taken out of the said seminary,
and that only the eight before decided upon be left, since those were his vassals. He allows at the most, sixteen boarders,
and all those shall enter only by permission of the governor of these islands, as the vice-patron; and the building of the
said seminary which his Majesty had before ordered shall be promoted. If there should be persons, who in good faith would
have aided the new seminary with buildings, incomes, and other gifts, it is asked that they consent to apply these on the
building of the seminary intended and ordered by his Majesty. In case that they do not agree to that, the just price of whatever
can be useful for this desirable end shall be paid to them; and what is useless shall be restored to its owners, except such
buildings as may not be necessary, which shall be immediately demolished.

</p>
<p>550. By virtue of the royal decree to the royal Audiencia, and those decrees which accompanied it for the archbishop and governor
of Manila, the building which (as above stated) was already begun was demolished, and today it is used as the summer palace
of the governors; and all the orders expressed in the said decrees were carried out. On May 6, 1712, the course of arts was
inaugurated in the royal seminary of San Phelipe (for thus did his Majesty order it to be called, and that the name of San
Clemente be erased), with the bachelor Don Bartholome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>Caravallo, presbyter, as master. He was appointed by decree of the superior government, during the governorship of the count
of Lizarr&acirc;ga, Don Martin de Ursua. Doctor Don Francisco Fermin de Viv&agrave;r was appointed master of theology on July 5, 1714.
At his death, the master Don Ignacio Mariano Garcia, who is at present doctor in theology, canon of this holy church, and
rector of the said royal college, succeeded to the office. After that time, they began to have public theological theses there,
with the help of the communities of Manila. Still later, esteeming it advisable for the royal treasury, the offices of master
of arts and theology were suspended, and only that of master of grammar is preserved. The seminarists who may choose to continue
their scholastic studies, go to the university of Santo Thomas to hear lecturers there. That is the present course; and the
said seminarists, after being present at the service of the cathedral church&#8212;their first duty&#8212;go to the university of Santo
Thomas for the ordinary lectures which are given to them.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1798">
<h4>Royal professorships</h4>
<p>551. In the year 1717, his Majesty (may God preserve him) sent three professors to the city of Manila, with suitable salaries,
to erect and conduct three professorships&#8212;of canons, institutes, and laws: these were in fact, erected and conducted in this
city, in one of its most notable and roomy houses. In the year 1724, because of the promotion by the king of Don Julian de
Velasco, one of the professors, to the royal Audiencia of M&eacute;xico, and as there were no suitable persons [for these chairs]
the royal Audiencia of these islands communicated that fact to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>his Majesty on June 10, 1726, as well as the small results and increased expenses that were experienced from those professorships.
Therefore, the royal Audiencia had made provision, while awaiting a new royal order, for maintaining the two professorships,
with the same two lecturers who held them. However, there was some change, the professorship of canons being given to the
very reverend father Pedro Murillo Velarde, of the holy Society of Jesus; while the place where the lectures were given was
changed to the college of San Ignacio, of the same Society, where its provincial generously assigned a room for the exercise
[of these lectureships] and for literary functions. In view of that, the king ordained, by his decree of July 26, 1730, the
suspension of everything enacted therein by that Audiencia&#8212;doing away, for the time being, with the foundation of the royal
university; and saving the royal treasury more than ten thousand pesos per annum, which had been fruitlessly spent. Now, very
recently, his Majesty, by a decree dated San Lorenzo, October 23, 1733, has determined that there shall be a chair of canons
and another of institutes in the college of San Ignacio; and he also determines that there shall be the same at the university
of Santo Thomas. Such is the present condition of the king&#8217;s professorships, until a new order is given.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1805">
<h4>Royal seminary of Santa Potenciana</h4>
<p>552. The royal seminary of Santa Potenciana was built in Manila, where it is situated, in the year 1591. At that time Don
Fray Domingo de Salaz&agrave;r was bishop, and he aided it with his alms; while the governor of the islands was Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>It was established in some houses and on a plot of ground given for that purpose by Captain Luis de Vibanco, factor of the
royal treasury. There also was built the church with the title of St. Andrew the apostle, the patron saint of Manila. That
church is thought to be [on the site of] the ancient chapel of St. Andrew which, as appears, was in that same spot, according
to several papers which I have seen of the year 1580. The seminary has been, and is, used for orphan girls, the daughters
of Spanish parents, to give them good education and rearing. It is under the royal patronage; and his Majesty takes care of
the maintenance of the seminarists, and helps them as far as may be necessary. Some pupils, some servants, and even some reformed
women are received also. For the last named, Licentiate Don Francisco Gomez de Arellano, archdeacon of Manila, and provisor
of this archbishopric, built a separate room. He furnished the reredos of the principal altar, and gave several other alms
and support for the purpose of changing that seminary to a monastery of nuns; but he was unable to attain his purpose, for
God cut short the thread of his life. They have their own chaplain, their rectoress, and their portress; and they live safely
retired and with holy mode of life.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1812">
<h4>Royal brotherhood of the Santa Misericordia</h4>
<p>553. The royal brotherhood of the Santa Misericordia of the city of Manila is composed of the members of the most prominent
families of Manila. They have their overseer, twelve deputies, and a secretary, who form their executive board, besides other
officers for their necessary transaction of business. They were established in imitation of the one which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>was erected in Lisb&ocirc;a, in the year 1498, by the most serene queen of Portugal&#8212;Do&ntilde;a Leonor, at that time the widow of Don Juan
the Second, who had died in the year 1495 as appears in all the Portuguese histories. Their founder was a Trinitarian religious
of praiseworthy life, one Fray Miguel de Contreras. The Misericordia of Manila is due to the pious and fervent efforts of
that venerable servant of God. Father Juan Fernandez de Leon, a secular priest, a native of Gibra-Leon, in the county of Niebla
in Andalucia, at the time when this archbishopric was governed by the very reverend father Fray Christoval de Salvatierra,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1819src" href="#xd0e1819">10</a> of the Order of Preachers, and the Philipinas Islands by Don Luis Gomez [<i>sic</i>: error for <i>Perez</i>] Dasmari&ntilde;as. This holy brotherhood was established April 16, 1594, with the liberal alms of all the nobility of Manila, and
the above-named governor was appointed its first overseer. The three who co&ouml;perated for its establishment and the formation
of its constitution, were Father Per&eacute;yra, of the holy Society of Jesus, father Fray Marcos de Lisb&ocirc;a, a Franciscan, and Don
Christoval Gir&agrave;l, all three of them Portuguese. In the church of the Society of Jesus at Manila met the most reverend father
Fray Christoval de Salvatierra, the venerable dean Don Diego Basquez de Mercado, and the said venerable Juan Fernandez de
Leon; the venerable fathers Antonio Sede&ntilde;o and Raymundo de Prado, of the holy Society of Jesus; the venerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>fathers Fray Agustin de Tordesillas, Fray Marcos de Lisb&ocirc;a, Fray Alonso Mu&ntilde;oz, and Fray Juan Bautista, of this seraphic [<i>i.e.</i>, Franciscan] province; together with the magistrates, regidors, and superior officers of the army of the city, and other
persons of education and talents, both ecclesiastics and laymen.

</p>
<p>554. Thus erected, and in accordance with its erection, the Santa Misericordia remained with the temporal management, and
our province with the spiritual management, of the hospital, which from that time began to be called the Misericordia [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;House of Mercy&#8221;] of the Franciscan fathers&#8212;which before had been cared for by the venerable Leon and our venerable Fray
Juan Clemente; and the erection of the said hospital in proper shape was considered.

</p>
<p>555. They built a church with the title of &#8220;<span lang="es">Presentacion de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora</span>&#8221; [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Presentation of our Lady&#8221;], and a house and seminary with that of Santa Isabel, in order to rear Spanish orphan girls with
thorough instruction in Christian doctrine and with good morals. It had a rectoress to care for and govern it, and a portress.
Thence the girls go out with dowries sufficient for the estate [of marriage] to which they naturally tend, for which purpose
the holy Misericordia appropriates sixteen thousand pesos. The girls who study there, who all the time are supported with
whatever is necessary, number about sixty, besides some pupils, six slave girls, and other servants. For their expenses and
those of their chaplains ten thousand seven hundred pesos are appropriated. It is a seminary of so great reputation and honor
that, although it has been used from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>its beginning as a refuge for girls&#8212;the daughters of poor Spaniards, whom the brothers obtain from various houses and from
Santa Potenciana&#8212;the best citizens of the community do not hesitate today to send their daughters there. Thence they go out
to assume the state of matrimony, or as nuns of St. Clare. Their church is very capacious, of beautiful architecture, and
very richly adorned. It was used as the cathedral (as above stated) until the year 1662, when the cabildo took possession
of its new church.

</p>
<p>556. Not only does this brotherhood have in charge today the support of this girls&#8217; seminary, and of the hospital of the Misericordia
(although the latter is at present under the charge of the hospital order), but there is no class of persons which does not
experience the charity of this holy house, through the generous alms that its executive board distributes. If the royal Misericordia
of Lisb&ocirc;a boasts that 30,000 ducados of private alms and other sums, which are spent nearly every year for the redemption
of captives, were distributed in one year, there is not a year that this great charitable institution does not spend 70,000
pesos in various purposes of charity, such as those already mentioned&#8212;poor Spaniards who are unwilling to ask alms, and prisoners,
and masses for the blessed souls&#8212;so that it is estimated that this holy house has given 3,448,506 pesos in alms from the year
1599 until that of 1726. That sum has been produced by the pious bequests that have been left for charitable purposes by the
inhabitants of Manila. To this should be added the advances that have been made to the general fund of these islands, in cases
of extreme necessity and invasions by the enemy, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>years 1646, 650, 653, 663 to 668, and to that of 1735. The total, according to an accurate computation, amounts to 1,069,099
pesos.

</p>
<p>557. The Misericordia takes care of the financial affairs of twenty-nine collative and of ten laical chaplaincies; and, in
the royal college of San Joseph, of two fellowships.

</p>
<p>558. It is governed by its own special rules, and their observance imposes the obligation of mortal sin. It has remarkable
and venerated reliquaries. It enjoys many privileges from the supreme pontiffs, and innumerable indulgences. It is under the
immediate royal protection by a royal decree of his Majesty, dated Sevilla, March 25, 1733, countersigned by Don Miguel de
Villanueva, the king&#8217;s secretary. Concession was granted in that decree to place the royal arms in their church and college;
to go out as a corporation on Holy Thursday to make the round of the stations; and entire credit is to be given in all the
tribunals to the instruments of the secretary of the executive board.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1862">
<h4>Other charitable institutions</h4>
<p>559. There are other charitable institutions in Manila in emulation of that of the holy Misericordia, although not so wealthy:
in the cathedral church, in the seraphic tertiary order of the convent of Manila, in that of the convent of Dilao, in [the
convent of] St. Dominic, in their convent of Binondoc, in their beaterio, in the convent of the calced Augustinian fathers,
in that of the discalced Augustinians, and in that of the Society. All of them serve as a refuge for the poor; for from them
is obtained money in proportion to good securities, and on pledges of gold and silver, at moderate rates of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>interest, for the trade of merchants, with which the poor Spaniards engage in business and increase their wealth. Their returns
are used for the various charities purposed by the founders who placed their money there&#8212;such as divine worship; alms for
the orders; dowries for poor Spanish, Indian, and mestiza girls, and for those of the Cavite shore; alms for the self-respecting
poor; hospitals and prisons; and suffrages for the blessed souls in purgatory&#8212;which are perennial.

<h3 class="normal">Curacies and employments of religious in this archbishopric</h3>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1874">
<h4>Curacies</h4>
<p>560. There are thirteen secular curacies and their visitas in all the archbishopric of Manila. In the Manila cathedral there
are two&#8212;one for Spaniards, and one for natives. In the province of Tongdo is the curacy of Santiago; that of La Hermita de
Guia, and that of Quiapo, the latter being an archiepiscopal house. In the jurisdiction of Cavite, the curacy of that port
and city, and that of the natives of San Roque. In the province of Balay&agrave;n, the curacy of Balay&agrave;n and that of El Rosario.
In the province of Laguna de Bai, the curacy of Tunas&agrave;n, that of Tab&ugrave;co, and that of Santo Thomas in the mountains. In the
jurisdiction of Mind&ograve;ro, the curacy of Lub&agrave;n. In all those curacies there are now administered about [<i>blank in original</i>] souls.



</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1882">
<h4>Calced Augustinians</h4>
<p>561. The calced Augustinian religious have their convent and church within the archbishopric. It is all of stone arches, and
is located in Manila; and art <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>has employed all its beauties in its building, and it is of special size and beauty. There live, as a general thing, fifty
religious, all of well-known talents; and they have quarters for novitiates and study, for those who need them. This was the
first order which (in the year 1565) conquered these islands; through their first prelate and father of them all, the venerable
Fray Andr&egrave;s de Urdan&egrave;ta, a Biscayan, and a son of the convent and province of M&eacute;xico. This convent of Manila is the head of
all the province of Dulcissimo Nombre de Jesus, and of all the parochial convents that are possessed throughout the province
by the Augustinians, to wit, as follows:

</p>
<p>562. In the province of Tongdo: the convents of Tongdo, Tamb&ograve;bong, Mal&agrave;te, Para&ntilde;aque, P&agrave;sig, and Tagui. According to the last
census, those convents minister to 21,959 souls.

</p>
<p>563. The sanctuary of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guadal&ugrave;pe on the river of Manila, where there are no Indians in its charge, and where
only a few religious stay for the worship of that holy image.

</p>
<p>564. In the province of Bai, the province of San Pablo de los Montes, which has in charge 2,600 souls.

</p>
<p>565. In the province of Ta&agrave;l or Balay&agrave;n: the convents of Ta&agrave;l, with the holy sanctuary of the miraculous Virgin, and of Cas&agrave;ys&agrave;y
and its administration; that of B&agrave;uan, that of Bat&agrave;ngas, that of Tan&agrave;uan, that of Sal&agrave;, and that of Lip&agrave;&#8212;with 14,628 souls.

</p>
<p>566. In the province of Bulac&agrave;n: the convents of the villages of Bulac&agrave;n, Dapdap, Guiguint&ograve;, Big&agrave;a, Ang&agrave;t, Baliu&agrave;g, Quingua,
Mal&ograve;los, Paomb&ograve;ng, Calumpit, and Hag&ograve;noy&#8212;with 23,303 souls.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>567. In the province of Pampanga: the convents of the villages of Bac&ograve;lor, Macab&egrave;be, Sesm&ograve;an, Lub&agrave;o, Vau&agrave;, Min&agrave;lin, B&egrave;tis,
P&ograve;rac, Pueblo de M&eacute;xico, Ar&agrave;yat, Mag&agrave;lang, Tarl&agrave;c, Gap&agrave;ng, Sant&ograve;l (with its missions, and the new village of San Sebastian),
San Miguel de May&ograve;mo, Cand&agrave;ba, Cabacs&agrave;, Ap&agrave;lit&#8212;with 38,513 souls.

</p>
<p>568. In the mountains of the same province of Pampanga, within a radius of twenty-four leguas, there is a most flourishing
mission of several barbaric nations, in which 4,500 souls are converted.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1904src" href="#xd0e1904">11</a>

</p>
<p>569. The order of our father St. Francis of the discalced religious followed the Augustinians in point of their establishment
in these islands; but I shall leave them for the last place in this book, in order to give precedence to the guests from outside,
who honor my work.



</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1909">
<h4>Society of Jesus</h4>
<p>570. The holy Society of Jesus came to these islands with their two vigorous apostolic leaders, Father Antonio Sede&ntilde;o and
Father Alonso Sanchez&#8212;who were most helpful companions of Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, the first bishop of Manila&#8212;in the year
1581. They have their principal college in Manila, whose titular is St. Ignatius. It is a sumptuous edifice, and head of all
the colleges (which are eight in number, the houses proper of the order), and of all the residences and missions of these
islands. In this chief college is situated the pontifical and royal university of letters.

</p>
<p>571. It is assured that Pope Julius III was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>first to concede the power of granting degrees to the holy Society of Jesus, on October 22, 1552; but only to Jesuit scholars.
Afterward Pius IV extended this faculty to outside students, August 19, 1561. Lastly, it was all confirmed by his Holiness,
Gregory XIII, May 7, 1578, that pope declaring that the prefect of studies could give the degrees. Urban VIII, on petition
of the sovereigns Phelipe III and Phelipe IV, decreed that degrees could be given in the Indias by the hands of the bishops,
in the colleges of the Society, as was once practiced in Manila by Archbishop Serrano. And because it was not continued, that
college of San Ignacio availed itself of the privileges already noted, and of which mention is made in libro i, t&iacute;tulo xxii,
law ii, of the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de Indias</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1921src" href="#xd0e1921">12</a> Wherefore it appears that the holy Society gave degrees in Manila by pontifical and regal authority. Later his Holiness,
Gregory XV, by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>brief <i lang="la">Apud S. Mariam Mayorem</i>, conceded, on August 8, 1621, the same privilege, but with the following restriction, <i lang="la">pr&aelig;sentibus ad decennium dum-tax&agrave;t valituris</i>, and that decennial was completed in the year 1631. Then on May 12, 1653, a royal writ of execution was issued, granting
authority to graduate students from the college of San Ignacio or that of San Joseph. In the year 1718, the royal university
was started in these islands, and it was maintained until the year 1726. As one of the professors was promoted to the royal
Audiencia of M&eacute;xico, the chair of the morning classes in canonical law was given to the very reverend father Pedro Murillo
Velarde, of the same Society, who had been professor of these branches in the universities of Granada and Salamanca, as a
collegiate in the imperial university of San Miguel of Granada, and of the chief [college] of Cuenca at Salamanca. But on
account of the increased expenses occasioned by this royal university, and as the benefits derived therefrom, as experience
demonstrated, were little, this royal Audiencia of Manila determined that these professorships should be located&#8212;as it were,
in trust&#8212;in the college of San Ignacio of Manila. That was in fact done, the Society showing this courtesy to his Catholic
Majesty&#8212;until, by a decree dated July 26, 1730, those professorships are now suppressed, and other provision has been made.
Now, very recently, the chief college of San Ignacio has, besides the privileges above cited, two new chairs&#8212;one of canonical
law, without a salary, directed by a religious; and the other of institutes, under a layman, with four hundred pesos of income,
in accordance with a decree from the Escorial, dated October 23, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>1733. The college is authorized to grant degrees in canons, laws, and other branches by his Holiness, Clement XII, by his
brief of December 6, 1735. Many are taking those studies, and are deriving great advantages therefrom. Their literary exercises
are very excellent, and continue [throughout their course of study] under the careful guidance of the holy Society, which
is not a new thing.

</p>
<p>572. The royal college of San Joseph, contiguous to the above college of San Ignacio, and near the royal gate of Manila, has
for its origin a royal decree of Phelipe II, dated June 8, 1585, wherein the governor of these islands&#8212;who was to confer with
the bishop of the islands as to the means&#8212;was ordered to institute a college, and support religious who were to teach Latin,
the sciences, and good morals to those who should attend. In obedience to that decree, the said college of San Joseph was
founded in the year 1595. Twelve fellowships were created, and one thousand pesos assigned from the royal treasury. A deed
of it was given on condition that the college was to be called a royal college, and that the arms of his Majesty were to be
placed on it. A few years afterward, by the will left by Estevan Rodriguez de Figuer&ograve;a, governor and captain-general of the
island of Mindan&agrave;o, this college was established from the foundations in his name. It had a sufficient number of students,
and a continually brilliant exercise in the branches of learning, which is flourishing in these times. Its antiquity, and
its precedence to that of Santo Tomas, is defined by the royal Council of the Indias, in a contradictory judgment, which appears
from a royal decree or writ of execution dated March 12, 1653. The title <i lang="la">Real ad honorem</i>, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>authority to place it on all its acts and despatches, and to place the royal arms on its gates, as we now see them, is a concession
of our Catholic king, by his royal order of May 3, 1722. Therefore this college is held in esteem and has a remarkable popularity.

</p>
<p>573. In the province of Tongdo [the Society has] [<i>marginal note</i>: residences or missions] in the villages of Santa Cruz, outside the Manila walls, and in San Miguel on the river of Manila;
up the river toward Laguna de Ba&igrave;, in the villages of San Pedro Macat&igrave;, San Matheo (with the missions of San Isidro, and Payn&agrave;an
in the mountains), Antip&ograve;lo, T&agrave;yt&agrave;y, Caint&agrave;, Mariqu&igrave;na, Sil&agrave;n, and Ind&agrave;ng.

</p>
<p>In the jurisdiction of Cav&igrave;te, in the village of Cav&igrave;te el Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, old Cavite], and in the port of Cav&igrave;te, a college without administration.

</p>
<p>In that of Mariv&egrave;lez, in the village of Marigond&ograve;ng.

</p>
<p>In the jurisdiction of Mind&ograve;ro, in the island of Marind&ugrave;que, in the villages of Bo&agrave;c, Santa Cruz de N&agrave;po, and G&agrave;sang.

</p>
<p>574. There is a beaterio, in the city of Manila, of respectable Indian women with their mistress, who have withdrawn from
the world, and are employed in holy living and exercises. Although the fathers of the Society do not have charge of it and
its government, because of the prohibition in their statutes, it is, through the common error of the crowd, called &#8220;<span lang="es">Las Beatas de la Compa&ntilde;ia</span>&#8221; [&#8220;Devout women of the Society&#8221;], for they hear mass, confess, and receive communion in their church at the college of the
Society.

</p>
<p>575. The number of souls in charge of the fathers of the Society throughout these islands and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>Marianas, according to the latest computation (of which the fathers have informed me), is one hundred and seventy thousand.

</p>
<p>This is all the total that I know from this point on, for the other bishoprics, which are lacking.



</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e1969">
<h4>St. Dominic</h4>
<p>576. The first religious of the order of our father St. Dominic who were known to have come to this archipelago were in the
year 1581&#8212;the first bishop, Don Fray Domingo de Salaz&agrave;r, and his associate, Fray Christoval de Salvatierra, the only survivor
of a very fine mission that his Excellency brought. But the first mission that came to establish itself in Manila consisted
of fourteen religious, under their vicar-general, Fray Juan de Castro, in the year 1587, on the eve of [Mary] Magdalene. This
holy religion has the merit of being more strict in Philipinas than in Europa; for its members do not receive honorable titles
or its convents incomes. Their habit is of unmixed frieze, and there is nothing to be asked for as a dispensation in their
regular observance. They have a very fine convent in the city of Manila, which supports about thirty religious of virtue and
learning. It is the chief convent of this most religious province of Santissimo Rosario.

</p>
<p>577. The pontifical and royal university of Santo Thomas, incorporated in this holy province of Santissimo Rosario of our
father St. Dominic, must recognize as its origin that venerable servant of God, the most illustrious and reverend Don Fray
Miguel de Venavides, of the same order, who while archbishop of Manila, planned this so noble a work in the year 1610&#8212;giving
all his library and about one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>thousand pesos, which was the amount of his property, to begin its foundation. He was followed by Don Fray Diego de S&oacute;ria,
of the same order, and bishop of Nueva Segovia in these islands, who bequeathed all his library and three thousand eight hundred
pesos for the continuation of this work. Consequently, by the year 1620 it already had lecturers and masters for the public
teaching of the sciences, by order of the superior government and the Audiencia of these islands, as appears from the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de Indias</i>, libro i, t&iacute;tulo xxii, ley liii.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1981src" href="#xd0e1981">13</a> After that three pontifical briefs were obtained, each one <i lang="la">ad decennium</i>, empowering them to graduate students from the courses of philosophy and theology. But Don Phelipe IV by his letter to the
count of Siruela, his ambassador in Roma, petitioned and obtained from his Holiness Innocent X the bull commencing <i lang="la">In supereminenti</i>, given at Roma, November 20, 1645. In that bull his Holiness erects a university in the college of Santo Thomas in due form,
with all the exemptions and privileges that other universities have, under the care of the Order of Preachers. Authority is
given to the rector to confer degrees, establish statutes, and appoint officials, his Holiness giving them the names proper
of university, etc., until an independent university of general studies should be founded in Manila. Afterward the king, by
a royal decree, dated Madrid, May 17, 1680, admitted the said university under his patronage and royal protection; and ordered
the governor, Audiencia, archbishop, and orders to so regard it, and to observe its statutes and exemptions. By another decree,
dated Madrid, November 22, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>1682, the king concedes authority for the erection of the chairs of laws and medicine in Santo Thomas. By another quite recent
decree, dated San Lorenzo, October 23, 1733, the king grants to the university of Santo Thomas two chairs&#8212;one of canonical
law, which is held by a religious who receives no salary; and the other of the institutes, in charge of a layman, appointed
by the royal Audiencia, and assigned a salary of four hundred pesos per annum, payable from the royal treasury, and to be
taken from [funds arising from] the vacant sees of the archbishop and bishops of these islands. The same favor is conferred
upon the college of San Ignacio of the Society. At present these two chairs are being maintained in both places. A petition
having been made to his Holiness in behalf of the said university, that authority be conceded it to graduate students in the
laws from it, his Blessedness Clement XII (who is at present governing the Church), concedes this, granting said chairs to
the university. His bull <i lang="la">Dudum emanarunt</i>, promulgated in Roma, September 2, 1734, in which he inserts the letter of Innocent above cited, and the permissions and
prerogatives there expressed (which are those of general universities), incorporates the said chairs, and those which may
be founded in the future, so that the university may be able to graduate students in them, and so that the graduates may enjoy
all the exemptions which are there mentioned.

</p>
<p>578. Thus does the order maintain that university, and it has men there of excellent learning and qualifications for public
teaching. There are a sufficient number of students and collegiates who hear instruction, illustrated in the public literary
exercises <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>in the sciences, and with all the other aids necessary. Its material edifice is very substantial and large and has a sufficient
number of apartments and class-rooms of goodly capacity. It is located next door to the convent of our father St. Dominic
in Manila.

</p>
<p>579. The seminary of San Juan de Letr&agrave;n was started by a Spaniard of excellent life, called Brother Juan Geronymo Guerrero,
who had in charge the rearing and teaching of poor and orphaned Spanish boys&#8212;whom, partly with his own money but more with
alms, he was supporting and had gathered in his house. For that purpose his Majesty granted him an encomienda in Yl&ograve;cos for
the support of the said boys. When he became quite old and helpless he retired, with the permission of the archbishop, to
the infirmary of St. Dominic, where he died a religious, having renounced in due form his house, encomienda, and all his other
property, so that he might give them to the order. The latter was to take charge of the education of the said orphans. So
in effect the seminary of the said boys was given to the order of our father St. Dominic with all the aforesaid incomes, besides
a piece of land one hundred brazas long by fifty wide (which they were to choose) in the Pari&aacute;n&#8212;free, and without paying land-tax
to the city&#8212;as a help toward its support. That transfer was made by decree of Governor Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcu&egrave;ra,
dated Manila, June 18, 1640, as appears from the first document in the book of the foundation of said seminary. In that book
is seen its erection into a seminary with the advocacy of St. John of the Lateran, as appears from the acts of the archbishop
and provisor, and from the other solemnities, found on leaves 5&#8211;11 inclusive. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>Their principal rule was the education of the said orphans, so that they might go thence as soldiers, and to occupy other
posts in the community. Now most of them become priests, studying the branches of philosophy and theology; and almost all
the seculars of the bishopric of Camarines, and many others in the other bishoprics of the islands, come from that seminary.
From the said seminary, there have been already graduated with great credit four doctors through the university of Santo Thomas,
two of whom are now canons of this metropolitan church&#8212;one, provisor of Yl&ograve;cos; and the other, chief chaplain of the Misericordia.
Some incomes in the royal chapel have been added to the said seminary, and a seraphic tertiary order with which fifty collegiates
are regularly maintained in education for the order of our father St. Dominic.

</p>
<p>580. In the suburbs of Manila, the Dominicans have the hospital of San Gabriel for the Chinese, and the convent and church
of Santos Reyes [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;holy kings&#8221;], with the administration of the same Christian Chinese, who live and trade here.

</p>
<p>581. In the province of Tongdo, this order has charge of the village of Binond&ograve;c and the convent of San Juan del Monte (but
without any administration), up the river of Manila.

</p>
<p>582. In the province of Pamp&agrave;nga, the convents and administration of the villages of Aboc&agrave;y, S&agrave;mal, Ori&ograve;ng, Oran&igrave;, with some
visitas and missions. In these administrations they have in charge sixteen thousand souls.

</p>
<p>In the port of Cavite, a convent without administration.

</p>
<p>583. Inside the city of Manila, the royal beaterio <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>of Santa Cathalina is incorporated with the province of Santissimo Rosario. It was established in the year 1695, in the house
and on the ground given for that purpose by Don Antonio Esguerra with some shops of the Pari&aacute;n for its support. Accordingly,
some <i>beatas</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, devout women] lived there in retreat for some years, in the care of the Dominican religious. Later General Don Juan Esca&ntilde;o
took charge of the maintenance of the said beatas. He left a considerable portion of his property for that purpose, specifying
that there should be fifteen Spanish beatas for the choir, and sufficient lay-sisters to take care of the beaterio. Today
it is a house worthy of deep veneration and respect. The king has incorporated it in his royal patronage, with authority to
have a public church with bells and a choir, and permission to celebrate the divine offices. They have a cloister, and profess
the tertiary order of the Dominicans. The only thing necessary to perfect their lives, and which they desire, is profession
as nuns.



</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e2027">
<h4>Discalced Augustinians</h4>
<p>584. The discalced religious of the great father of the Church, St. Augustine, entered Manila in the year 1606. Although they
were the last evangelical workers, their apostolic zeal has extended in rivalry to the first ones, and they have attained
abundant results from their labors, in the reduction of the most barbarous islanders, and in the exemplary lives of their
reformed religious. The first convent in which they lived was the one now called San Juan de Bagongb&aacute;yan, outside the walls
of the city of Manila. It was established with the title of San Nicolas de Tolentino, which is still preserved (without administration),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>with the veneration merited, not only by their primacy but by the miraculous image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Salud [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;our Lady of health&#8221;] who is venerated there. Later, a convent was erected in due form under the ancient advocacy of St.
Nicholas of Tolentino, that saint being today the titular of that most strict province. In that convent, which is inside and
near the walls of Manila, there are generally maintained thirty or forty religious. They have the reputation of being a community
as well regulated as the best in Castilla, and one in which have been known a great number of fathers of holiness and learning.
From that convent they go out to perform their laborious ministrations in these islands. Their houses in this archbishopric
are as follows.

</p>
<p>585. In the province of Tongdo, the convent of San Sebastian near Manila, where the miraculous image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del
Carmen [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;our Lady of Carmen&#8221;] is revered, and she has a Confraternity of the holy Escapular, with very fervent devotion. There are
three hundred and thirty-six souls ministered to in that convent.

</p>
<p>586. In the jurisdiction of Mariv&egrave;lez: in the villages of Mariv&egrave;lez, Cabc&agrave;ben, Bag&agrave;c, M&ograve;rong; and they have administration
between S&uacute;bic and the point of Bolin&agrave;o, which is the country of the Zamb&agrave;les. They also have some missions in the mountains
near by. In that district they care for 8,550 souls.

</p>
<p>587. All of the island of Mind&ograve;ro is under the charge of those religious, where in various villages, visitas, missions, and
settlements, they minister to 7,552 souls.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>588. In the port of Cavite, they have another convent, a dwelling for the religious without any administration of Indians.

</p>

</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e2054">
<h4>St. John of God</h4>
<p>589. The hospital Order of St. John of God, although their institute is the hospital and the treatment of bodies, have not
a few times served as medicine for souls, under the spur of the apostolic zeal of those charitable religious. Although it
appears from a royal decree of February 10, 1617, that permission was given for ten religious for these islands, one cannot
find evidence of the time of their entrance. They can only be found in the year 1649, with a hospital of convalescents in
Ragongbayan, outside the walls of Manila, with their superior, the very reverend prior vicar-provincial, Fray Francisco de
Magallanes.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2059src" href="#xd0e2059">14</a> Cession was made to him, as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>head of his order, of the old hospital, which was founded by our Fray Juan Clemente. The Santa Misericordia of Manila, under
the title of &#8220;Hospital of the Misericordia of the Franciscan fathers,&#8221; managed its financial affairs&#8212;as appears from the written
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>statement of the said executive board of May 13, 1656, and from the permissions of Archbishop Poblete, of May 11 of the said
year, and of Governor Don Sabiniano, of March 22 of the same year. His Catholic Majesty approved that gift by his royal decree
of December 5, 1659. That hospital continually suffered ever-recurring disasters, until the arrival at these islands of the
very reverend father Fray Antonio Arce, in July of 1726, as its head and superior. Such has been his zeal and prudence that
he has merited the glorious title of restorer of the hospital order in these islands, in its organization and affairs. For
now, not only is it seen to be glorified by a very large, distinguished, and devout community, but they have built a sumptuous
church from the foundations, excellent sick wards, and the house of the religious, almost to the extreme of perfection. They
began so grand and vast a work November 28, 1728, when his Excellency Archbishop Don Carlos Vermudez blessed the first stone,
in the presence of Governor Marquis de Torre Campo (who began that building with two thousand pesos, which he gave that afternoon
as alms), and the most noble and prominent people of this community.

</p>
<p>590. There was another hospital in Cavite, but it was swallowed up in the sea. At present a common house is used there as
a hospital. The same thing is true of Zeb&ugrave;. All that will be remedied, as is proved by experience, if the providence of God
do not fail it, as hitherto it has not.



</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e2097">
<h4>Discalced Franciscans</h4>
<p>591. Our discalced religious came to these islands immediately following the Augustinian fathers, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>the year 1577. They were the founders of the custodia of San Phelipe, which was later entitled San Gregorio. Now the province
of the discalced Franciscans has the same title. Its first founder was the venerable Fray Antonio de San Gregorio, and its
first custodian, the venerable Fray Pedro de Alfaro. Possession was taken of the new convent of Manila, August 2, 1577, and
the most holy sacrament was placed in their church of Santa Maria de los Angeles [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;St. Mary of the Angels&#8221;]. That was the first receptacle [for the sacrament], or sacristy, that his Majesty had in these
islands. In this convent the community ceremonies are observed, in accordance with the rigor of the rules of Espa&ntilde;a. There
is a well-served infirmary, and [opportunity for] studies, when that is necessary. It generally contains thirty religious,
according as the climate and other accidents of this country permit. This convent is the mother and head of this holy province,
whence go religious to minister to the places in our charge. They are as follows.

</p>
<p>592. In the archbishopric of Manila: in the province of T&ograve;ngdo, in the villages of Dil&agrave;o Samp&agrave;loc, Pand&agrave;can, and Santa Ana
de S&agrave;pa&#8212;sanctuaries very famous for the miraculous images of our Lady and of the child Jesus&#8212;where 7,900 souls are ministered
to.

</p>
<p>593. In the province of Bulac&agrave;n: in the villages of P&ograve;lo, Meycauay&agrave;n, Boc&agrave;ui, with their visitas, where 19,500 souls are ministered
to.

</p>
<p>594. In the province of Laguna de Ba&igrave;: in the villages of M&ograve;rong, Bar-&agrave;s, Tan&agrave;y, Pililla, Mabitac, Cab&ocirc;an, Sinil&ocirc;an, Pangil,
Panquil, Pa&egrave;te, Longos, Lucban, Cauinti, Pagsangh&agrave;n, Santa Cruz (with its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>infirmary), Pila, Ma&igrave;nit (with the hospital of the sulphur-water baths), Nagcarl&agrave;n, Lilio, and Mah&agrave;yh&agrave;y in the mountains.
And now lately, by cession of the Augustinian fathers, the villages of Ba&igrave;, and Binangonan de los Ferros [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Binangonan of the dogs&#8221;], with the settlement of Angono. In all those villages, and their visitas, 40,534 souls are ministered
to.

</p>
<p>595. In the mountains of Dara&euml;tan, which extend from Laguna de Ba&igrave; to the opposite coast of Val&egrave;r, there is a mission with
about four hundred converted souls, and many others to convert.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2120src" href="#xd0e2120">15</a>

</p>
<p>596. There is another convent outside the walls of Manila, at one legua&#8217;s distance, called San Francisco del Monte, without
administration, but used only for the spiritual retreat of the religious, which has its guardian.

</p>
<p>597. Near the royal magazines of Manila stands the celebrated convent of the nuns of our mother St. Clare. They are subject
to this province, and are governed by their vicar, a religious of this province. Its foundation and attending circumstances
are treated in the body of these chronicles.

</p>
<p>598. Within the court or enclosure of our convent of Manila, there is a very sumptuous chapel with the most holy sacrament,
for the attendance and exercises of the venerable tertiary order, administered and governed by a religious, a commissary-visitor,
a son of this holy province.

</p>
<p>599. Outside the walls of Manila, near the village of Dil&agrave;o, stands the hospital of San Lazaro, whose spiritual and temporal
administration is, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>has always been, in charge of the discalced Franciscan religious.

<h3 class="label">Chapter LI</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Bishopric of Zebu</h3>
<p>600. It has been stated above, in the list of the archbishops of Manila, that the bishopric of Zebu is one of the three suffragans
which Pope Clement VIII erected for these Philipinas Islands by his brief of August 14, 1595. This is the most extensive,
not only because of its territory in the islands, but because its jurisdiction also includes the Marianas Islands. The episcopal
see is established in the city of Dulcissimo Nombre de Jesus (before called San Miguel)&#8212;founded in the month of April, 1565&#8212;in
its very spacious wooden church, which is dedicated to the holy guardian angel (unless it be dedicated to the holy archangel,
St. Michael, as is so fitting, as he was the first titular of that village). That church has its sacristy, with its cura and
sacristan. There is a provisor, and some secular clergy with benefices are located in some of the islands of its jurisdiction.
In that city the order of the great father St. Augustine has a convent, in which is venerated [an image of] the most miraculous
child Jesus, found at the conquest of the city; a college of the Society of Jesus; a convent of the discalced Augustinians;
and perhaps one or several religious of St. John of God. Toward the eastern part of the island of Zeb&ugrave; is located the city,
with some Spanish houses&#8212;although now only one or two Spaniards live there with the alcalde-mayor, who is the governor, chief
justice, general of the soldiers in Pintados, and castellan of the fort in the same city; two alcaldes-in-ordinary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>one lieutenant of royal officials, three regidors, two notaries, one city steward, and one chief constable. There is a district
for the Sangleys, who form a Pari&aacute;n. The above is all that is most noteworthy regarding the city of Zeb&ugrave;.


</p>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e2142">
<h4>Jurisdiction of this bishopric</h4>
<p>601. The bishopric of Zeb&ugrave; extends, with its jurisdiction, throughout the province of L&egrave;yte; throughout that of Zeb&ugrave;, with
the adjacent islands, as above stated; the province of Car&agrave;ga; the province of Pan&agrave;y, with the jurisdiction of Ogt&ograve;ng, and
adjacent islands; as far as the Calami&agrave;nes, and Par&agrave;gua; the northern coast of Mindan&agrave;o; and the Marianas Islands.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e2147">
<h4>Stipends of the bishops of these islands</h4>
<p>602. His Excellency the bishop of Zeb&ugrave; receives an annual stipend of four thousand pesos of common gold, by virtue of a royal
decree dated May 28, 1680. The cura of the sacristy of that holy church receives 183 pesos 6 tomins 7 granos; the sacristan,
91 pesos 7 tomins 3 granos. The other two bishops, their curas, and sacristans, receive the same stipends, and for the same
reason.

<h4>Curacies</h4>
<p>615. The sickness and death of the bishop, and the distance of that bishopric, have delayed the news that I had hoped to receive
of the curacies in its district. Therefore, I shall proceed with the administrations of the religious throughout that bishopric.

<h4>Administrations of religious</h4>
<p>616. In the city of Zeb&ugrave; is the convent of the calced Augustinian fathers&#8212;the first temple and sacred repository of the miraculous
image of the holy Child that was discovered&#8212;where, as a rule, three religious live, without administration.

</p>
<p>617. Outside the walls is the convent of San Nicolas, or Zeb&ugrave; el Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Old Zeb&ugrave;&#8221;], which was the first village conquered by the Spaniards. Hence its natives are reserved from tribute, and are
ministered to by the Augustinian fathers. The number of souls reaches 3,504.

</p>
<p>618. The administrations of the villages of Arg&agrave;o, Boloh&ograve;n, Cotcot (with Liluan), in the island of Zeb&ugrave;, whose souls number

mountains, from whom little fruit was obtained until the year 1730. (In the year 1735, through the visit of our father provincial,
the very reverend father Fray Piego Verga&ntilde;o, they asked for religious very urgently, begging that some would live in their
villages. A great harvest of spiritual fruits is hoped from that.) In the village of Ildu&agrave;g; in that of Bangui, with other
small mission villages; and in that of Bacarra with that of Vera. All those administrations number 51,453 souls.

<p>687. Thus, the number of eight hundred and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>thirty-seven thousand one hundred and eighty-two Christian souls, among the natives of these islands&#8212;who are ministered to
spiritually in the above-mentioned provinces, villages, and settlements&#8212;is what I get from the special lists sent me for this
work by the holy orders, made according to the last enumeration, that for the years 1735 and 1736. I have supplied those which
have not been furnished to me (which I have solicited by various means) from the clergy of these islands, with the number
mentioned, which is placed by the very reverend father Pedro Murillo on his map.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2363src" href="#xd0e2363">19</a> This, together with the account of the royal officials for the year 1735, are the citations that I offer for the proof of
my account, if there should be any discrepancy between it and others. I reflect that no one can give a better account of the
treasury than he who has continual care of it. It is doubtless true that all or any of them may have unavoidable errors; for
the Indians are continually removing, dying, or absenting themselves. Consequently, I judge that the number of souls, of those
who are at this time reputed to be natives of these Islands, exceeds one million. The temples [of God] where the instruction
is given in villages and visitas are in excess of seven hundred, as was represented to his Catholic Majesty by the royal officials
in a report in the year 1720. As for the number of Spaniards and foreigners, the computation is extremely difficult and uncertain;
and therefore it is not safe to make a decisive statement.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>688. After very painstaking efforts, at the time when this book is in press I receive information about the curacies of the
seculars of Zeb&ugrave;, in the following form. The curacy of the sacristy of the holy church, and that of the Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys,
in the city of Zeb&uacute;; in the island of Zeb&uacute;, that of Bantay&agrave;n and Bar&iacute;li; in the island of Negros, in Dumagu&egrave;te, Binalb&agrave;gan,
Tuc&agrave;uan, and Tangh&agrave;y; in the island of Pan&agrave;y, in the city of Ar&eacute;balo, Ah&uacute;y, Acl&agrave;ng, Banga, Ybah&agrave;y, and Cul&aacute;si. Nearly all
those curacies are very large and need assistants. Throughout that jurisdiction and in the Marianas there are various outside
vicars, who are generally the religious of those regions. Such is the information which I have obtained from the provisor
of that bishopric; but he does not give the number of parishioners, as it is very difficult to ascertain it.

and conformity with heathen customs, and made complaint against them at Rome. For a time the Holy See permitted the practice
of the Chinese rites, but frequent contentions arose on this subject between the Jesuits and the other orders, which were
not definitely settled by Rome for many years. Finally, Clement XI sent Tournon (1703) to investigate the matter thoroughly,
who condemned the rites in question as idolatrous and was therefore imprisoned by the Chinese emperor. He died in this captivity
(1710), but his decision was accepted by the pope, and all Catholic missionaries to China were required to take an oath that
they would resist those rites to the utmost. See full account of this controversy, with citations of authorities, in Addis
and Arnold&#8217;s <i>Catholic Dictionary</i> (Meagher&#8217;s revision), pp. 926&#8211;928. For accounts of Tournon&#8217;s stay at Manila, and the dissatisfaction which he aroused there,

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href="#xd0e1760src" id="xd0e1760">8</a></span> Sidoti (or Sidotti) was an Italian priest who came to Manila with Tournon, intending to enter the forbidden land of Japan.
In 1709, he succeeded in doing this, by persuading the captain of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e1762" href="#xd0e1762">107n</a>]</span>a Spanish vessel to land him on the Japanese coast; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga says (<i lang="es">Hist. Philipinas</i>, pp. 420, 421) that nothing more had ever been learned regarding him. La Concepci&oacute;n, however, writing somewhat earlier, says
(<i lang="es">Hist. Philipinas</i>, vi, p. 82) that in 1716 news of Sidoti&#8217;s imprisonment and death arrived at Canton&#8212;the latter being attributed to his continual
fasts and austerities. But Griffis relates (<i>Mikado&#8217;s Empire</i>, pp. 262, 263) so much as may now be known about Sidoti&#8217;s fate, derived from a book&#8212;<i>Sei Y&#333; Ki Bun</i> (&#8220;Annals of Western Nations&#8221;)&#8212;written by the Japanese scholar who examined the priest, which gives the facts of the case,
and the judicial proceedings therein. Sidoti &#8220;was kept a prisoner, living for several years after his arrival, in Yedo (T&#333;ki&#333;),
and probably died a natural death.&#8221;

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href="#xd0e1921src" id="xd0e1921">12</a></span> This law (which is contained in the book entitled, &#8220;Concerning the universities, and general and private studies in the Indias&#8221;)
is as follows: &#8220;Permission is conceded for the cities of Santo Domingo in the island of Espa&ntilde;ola, Santa F&eacute; in the new kingdom
of Granada, Santiago de Guatemala, Santiago de Chile, and Manila in the Filipinas Islands, to have halls for study, and universities
where courses may be pursued and degrees given, for the time that has appeared advisable. For that we have obtained briefs
and bulls from the holy apostolic see, and we have conceded those universities certain privileges and pre&euml;minences. We order
that what has been ordained for the said halls of study and universities be kept, obeyed, and executed, without violating
it in any manner. Those universities which shall be limited in time, shall present themselves before our royal Council of
the Indias to petition for an extension of time, where the advisable measures will be taken. If no extension is granted, the
teaching of those studies shall cease and end; for so is our will.&#8221; A note to this law in the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> reads in part as follows: &#8220;It must be borne in mind that the universities, seminaries, conciliars, and other schools of learning
erected by public authority in the Indias were declared to be under the royal patronage by a circular letter of June 11, 1792.&#8221;

of Nueva Segovia is such a request. The original of this letter is in Archivo general de Indias, with the pressmark: &#8220;<span lang="es">Simancas; ecclesiastico; Audiencia de Filipinas; cartas y expedientes de los obispos sufraganeos de Manila, a saber, Nueva

probably remained a dead letter. (Cf. <span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. XVIII of this series, p. 114, dated 1618.)

had some one to distribute it efficiently, and to care for it properly, there would be sufficient aid from the many alms given
by the inhabitants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2072" href="#xd0e2072">132n</a>]</span>who can do something. It is most necessary for its good government and maintenance for your Majesty to send four or five brothers
from the order called [St.] John of God, who should have authority from your Majesty and from his Holiness to be able to receive
others; for now the matter is ready, and all that is necessary. Those brothers could come with the religious whom your Majesty
is sending&#8212;either Franciscans or Dominicans&#8212;or your Majesty could have them sent from the good brothers who are established
in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The latter would economize the expense, and the journey would be quicker and more certain. May our Lord preserve
your Majesty long years, for the welfare of His church. Manila, July 7, 1606. I kiss your Majesty&#8217;s royal hands,

<div class="div2" id="xd0e2381">
<h3 class="label">Chapter II</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the ministries of souls that pertain to the clerics in these Filipinas Islands</h3>
<p>In the assumption, so certain and evident, that the clerics, both seculars and regulars, had been the primitive apostles and
preachers of the holy gospel in the Orient and in these archipelagos, I commence with them to describe the ministries in these
islands that have been commended to their zeal and care. In the archbishopric of Manila, the curacies of the venerable clergy
amount to sixteen, besides some visitas. There is one for Spaniards, and one for natives, in the cathedral; that of Santiago,
outside the city; that of the chapel of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Gu&iacute;a; that of Quiapo, which belongs to the archiepiscopal jurisdiction:
these belong to the province of Tondo. In the jurisdiction of Cavite there are: that of the port of that city; outside the
walls, that of San Roque; not very distant, that of Bacoor; and another, called Las Estancias [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;the ranches&#8221;]. In the province of Taal is that of Balay&aacute;n; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>Rosario, in the province of Laguna de Bay; those of San Pedro, Tunas&aacute;n, Tabuco, and Santo Tom&aacute;s, in the mountains. In the
jurisdiction of Mindoro is that of Suban.

</p>
<p>In the bishopric of Sant&iacute;simo Nombre de Jes&uacute;s of Ceb&uacute;, there is one Spanish cura in the city, and outside the walls is that
of the Pari&aacute;n of mestizos and Sangleys; that of Barili in the same island, and that of Bantay&aacute;n (of whose jurisdiction are
the visitas of Maripipi, Panamao, and Limancauay&aacute;n); that of Siquijor, in that same island. In the island of Panay, the curacy
of Acl&aacute;n, Banga, Ibajay, Culasi, Ajui, and that of the town of Ar&eacute;valo (which his Excellency the bishop, Don Protasio Cabezas,
has lately conceded to the Society of Jesus). In the island of Negros, that of Dumaguete, with several visitas; and those
of Binalbagan, Tugcaban, and Tanhay.

</p>
<p>In the bishopric of Nueva C&aacute;ceres or Camarines, in the city which is the capital and seat of the bishopric, there is one cura
of the sacristy, who is provisor and vicar-general. In the same province are the curacies of Indang, Paracale, Capalonga,
Caramoan, and Lagonoy, with some visitas belonging to the same curacies. In the province of Tayabas are the curacies of Pyris,
Abuyon, Mulanay, and their visitas. In the province of Albay are the curacies of Bulusan, Casiguran, Sorsog&oacute;n, Donsol, Tabaco,
and Malinao, with their visitas. In the island of Catanduanes are the curacies of Biga and Birac, with their visitas.

</p>
<p>In the bishopric of Cagay&aacute;n is the curacy of Lalo or Nueva Segovia; in the province of Ilocos, that of Vigan, and that of
Bangar; and in the mountains that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>of Abra, and that of San Diego among the Tinguianes, with some separate visitas. Consequently, the venerable clergy in these
Islands have fifty-three beneficed curacies, which are new.

<h3 class="label">Chapter III</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the ministries of the reverend calced Augustinian fathers</h3>
<p>The reverend calced Augustinian fathers, the first founders of these missions, have one convent in Manila, which is the head
of all their province of Sant&iacute;simo Nombre de Jes&uacute;s, and of all the other parochial convents. In the province of Tondo, they
have charge of the village of that name, Tambobo, Malate, Para&ntilde;aque, P&aacute;sig, and Taguig, with various visitas annexed to them.
On the river P&aacute;sig, they possess the convent and sanctuary of Guadalupe, where several devout religious live who have charge
of the worship of the holy image. Further they have the ministry of San Pablo de los Montes, in the province of Taal and Balay&aacute;n;
the convents and ministries of Taal, Casay-say, Bauang, Batangas, Tanavan, Lipa, and Sala. In the province of Bulac&aacute;n, they
have the convent and ministry of that name, and those of Dapdap, Guiguinto, Big&aacute;a, Angat, Baliuag, Quingua, Malolos, Paombong,
Calumpit, and Haganoy. In the province of Pampanga, the convents and ministries of Bacolor, Macabebe, Sesmoan, Lubao, Vana,

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the bishopric of Sant&iacute;simo Nombre de Jes&uacute;s of Ceb&uacute; there is a convent called Santo Ni&ntilde;o in the same city [of Ceb&uacute;] with
its church newly built, where the vicar-provincial of all the Visayas Islands has his residence; and outside the walls the
convent of Ceb&uacute; el Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Old Ceb&uacute;&#8221;], and the ministry of San Nicol&aacute;s. In the same island are the convents and ministries of the villages of Argao,
Bolhon, Cabcat, with several visitas; the ministry and convent of Op&oacute;n in the island of M&aacute;gtan, with the visitas of Olango,
and Pangalanan, and others on the opposite coast of Ceb&uacute;. The reverend calced Augustinian fathers made a cession of the villages
and ministries of Bolhon, Op&oacute;n, and Liloan to the fathers of the Society of Jesus, by their chapter of the year 1737; but
afterward they recovered these, because of various just causes that they had for it, improved as to churches, houses, and
silver ornaments&#8212;except that of Liloan, a small visita which remained in the possession of the Society, and was incorporated
with the village of Mandaui, as it was near by. In the province of Panay are the convents and ministries of the capital city
of C&aacute;piz, Batan, Mambusao, Dumalag, Dumarao, and Panay; in the province of Ot&oacute;n, in the same island, the convents and ministries
of Magao, Antique, Bugason, Tigbauan, Cabutuan, Laglag, Pasi, Aanilao, Dumangas, the island of Guimar&aacute;s, Jaro, Ot&oacute;n, and Guimbal,
with several missions of wild people [<i>cimarrones</i>] in the mountains, apostates and their children, in which the care and zeal of the same fathers has been exercised since
the year 1731, and in which the gain and profit of many souls is not wanting.

</p>
<p>In the bishopric of Camarines they have the convent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>and ministry of the village of Tiaong, in the jurisdiction of the province of Tayabas. In the bishopric of Nueva Segovia or
Cagay&aacute;n, the province of Pangasin&aacute;n, they have the convents and ministries of Agoo, Santo Tom&aacute;s, and Aringay, with several
missions of Igorrotes in the mountains; those of Bauar, Bona, Daland&aacute;n, and Cava, with another mission of mountaineers; and
those of Bacnotan and San Juan, with another similar mission. In the province of Ilocos, they have the convent and ministry
of Namagpacan, with that of Balauan and its missions, and those of Bangar and Tagurin, with another mission; those of Cand&oacute;n,
Santa Luc&iacute;a de Narbacan, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and Bantay, with those of San Ildefonso and Nagsingal; that of Cabugao
with Lapog; that of Sinait with Badoc; those of Panay, Batag, San Nicol&aacute;s, Lecrat, and Dinglas, with that of Pirie; and various
missions of Tinguianes and heathen in those mountains, where the same reverend fathers are commencing to form villages to
the great advantage of those souls. They have that of Ilanag and that of Bangui, with other visitas and missions, and those
of Bacarra and Vera. All of those ministries and convents are adjudged to the same reverend fathers.

<h3 class="label">Chapter IV</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Convents and ministries of the reverend Franciscan fathers, the third to be established</h3>
<p>The reverend Franciscan fathers reached the Filipinas Islands in the year 1577. In Manila they have in their vigilant and
watchful care, close to the convent, a costly and beautiful chapel of the tertiary order of penance, in charge of a religious
who is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>commissary and visitor. There is also a convent of the nuns of St. Clare in the city, who are subject to and governed by the
same religious. They also possess another convent called San Francisco del Monte, one legua from the city; and a hospital
called San L&aacute;zaro, which they administer near the village of Dilao, which belongs to the province of Tondo; besides the villages
and ministries of Samp&aacute;loc, Pandacan, and Santa Ana de Zapa. In the province of Bulac&aacute;n, they have the convents and ministries
of Polo, Meycauayan, and Bocaue, with several visitas. In the province of Laguna de Bay, they have in charge the ministries

Pagsangh&aacute;n, Santa Cruz, Pila, and Mainit (where there is a hospital, called Los Ba&ntilde;os, because of the warm sulphur-charged
waters in those regions, for the cure of various ailments). In that same province are the ministries and convents of Nagcarlang,
Lilio, and Mahayhay; and lastly, by cession of the Augustinian fathers, the villages of Bay, and Binangonan, with the ranch

<h3 class="label">Chapter V</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Ministries of the Society of Jesus in these Filipinas Islands</h3>
<p>After the preaching of the apostle of the Orient, St. Francis Xavier, in these archipelagos, as far as the island of Mindanao
and Japon (as has been related already in its place), before the Spaniards were established in these islands, the first fathers
of the Society of Jesus reached these islands by way of the west or by the Western Indias, coming with the first bishop of
the islands, his Excellency Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, of the Order of Preachers&#8212;the city of Manila having been already
founded, and that colony established in some fashion&#8212;in September of the year 1581. The first founders were the fathers Antonio
Sede&ntilde;o and Alonso S&aacute;nchez, together with the lay-brother, Nichol&aacute;s Gallardo, the student brother, Gaspar de Toledo&#8212;a legitimate
brother to the illustrious doctor, Father Francisco Su&aacute;rez&#8212;having died on the voyage. For some years those fathers remained
without any ministry to the natives which they could permanently carry on, busied only in preaching, hearing confessions,
and aiding in what necessity or obedience ordered them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>Their first dwelling was in the convent of the seraphic father St. Francis, until they obtained a house of their own in the
suburbs of Manila, in the location called Aguio&#8212;whence, as facilities and opportunity came, they moved, and established themselves
inside the city, in the year 1591. There the Society has the chief residence of St. Ignatius, and a fine church where they
exercise to great and continual crowds all the ministries peculiar to their institute. In that residence, there is a pontifical
and royal university, of which we shall speak later, together with a royal college of San Jos&eacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2441src" href="#xd0e2441">1</a> and the college of the fathers, established near the royal gate of the city, in which are taught all useful learning and
arts, commencing with grammar.

</p>
<p>In the province of Tondo they have the residence [<i lang="es">colegio</i>] of Santa Cruz, lately admitted as such, which is jointly a ministry of Sangleys, mestizos, and natives; the village and
ministry of San Miguel, on the river brink; and about one legua above, the residence and novitiate of San Pedro Macati, with
a ministry of natives. In the mountains, the village and capital of Antipolo, with the village and ministry of Bosoboso, where
the natives of two mountain missions, called San Isidro and Pamaan, are settled together, whose administration was [there]
inconvenient, but who are now better governed and cared for. In the plains, the fathers administer the village of Taytay,
with a visita near by, called Santa Catalina; and the ministry of Cainta, with a visita of creoles called Dayap. Besides,
they have the village and ministry of Mariquina, of mestizos, Sangleys, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>and natives; and that of San Mateo, the village and capital of the residence of Sil&aacute;n and of Indang. In Cavite there is a
residence of the Society of Jesus, and in its jurisdiction the village and ministry of Cavite el Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Old Cavite&#8221;]; in that of Mariveles, the residence of Maragond&oacute;n; in the province of Mindoro, the island of Marinduque,
with the villages and ministries of Boac, Santa Cruz de Napo, and Gasan.

</p>
<p>In the bishopric and jurisdiction of Ceb&uacute; they have a residence in the city; the ministry of the village of Mandaui and Liloan;
in the island of Bohol, the ministries of Inabangan and Talibon, where is located the residence [<i lang="es">residencia</i>] of Bohol with the villages and ministries of L&oacute;boc, Baclayon, Dauis, Malabohoc, Tagbilaran (a new village), and another
on the bar of the river of L&oacute;boc, also new, named Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Most Holy Trinity&#8221;]; and, on the opposite coast of the island, the village and ministry of Hagna. In the island of Mindanao,
the presidio of Zamboanga, where residence has been begun, with a ministry, whose rector is the chaplain of that presidio;
those of Bagonbayan, Dumal&oacute;n, Siocon, Cabatangan, Caldera, Polombato, and Siraguay. In the northern part of the same island
the residence [<i lang="es">residencia</i>] and ministries of Dapitan, Iligan, Layavan, Langaran, Lubungan, Disacan, Talingan, and various visitas and missions on those
same coasts and the bay of Pangue.

</p>
<p>In the island of Negros, the ministries of Ilog, Cabancalan (with the mission of Buyonan), Himamayl&aacute;n, Cavayan, and the mission
of Sipalay. In the village of Iloilo and the jurisdiction of Oton there is a residence, whose rector is the chaplain of that
presidio (as is he of Zamboanga), and the ministry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>of Molo; and lastly, by concession of his Excellency Master Don Protasio Cabezas, the curacy of the town of Ar&eacute;valo, with
the Pari&aacute;n, was given to the Society. In the island of Samar, the capital and ministries of Catbalogan, Paranas, Humavas,

<h3 class="normal">Administrations of the reverend fathers of St. Dominic in these islands</h3>
<p>The religious of St. Dominic came to found a province in these islands with an excellent mission, in the year 1587, on the
eve of St. Mar&iacute;a Magdalena. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>Inside the city they have a sumptuous church and convent, which is the head of the most devout province of Sant&iacute;simo Rosario.
Near the same convent is the college and seminary of Santo Tom&aacute;s, with collegiates, which has its own rector. There are taught
all the belles lettres, commencing with grammar. It is a pontifical and royal university, and is attended by a sufficient
number of students when one considers the small size of this community. The pupils of another institution, called San Juan
de Letr&aacute;n&#8212;which was begun by a Spanish resident, one Brother Jer&oacute;nimo Guerrero, who dedicated himself to the shelter and education
of orphan boys and the sons of poor Spaniards&#8212;attend the said university. After his death that seminary remained in charge
of the same religious. Within Manila, there is a <i>beaterio</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2490src" href="#xd0e2490">2</a> whose pupils profess the tertiary Order of St. Dominic, although they do not make religious profession. They are numerous
and of exemplary life, and are subject to the same fathers. The latter possess a convent in the Sangley Pari&aacute;n, for ministration
to those of this nation who are converted. On the other side of the river they possess the hospital of San Gabriel, where
sick Chinese are treated; somewhat farther, the convent and ministry of Binondo; and on the river brink the convent of San
Juan del Monte, without administration [<i>i.e.</i>, of converts].

</p>
<p>In the province of Pampanga, the convents and ministries of Abucay, Samal, Oriong, Orani, with several visitas and missions;
in the port of Cavite, a convent without administration; in the province of Pangasin&aacute;n, the convents and administrations of

<p>The Recollect Augustinian religious arrived at Manila in the year 1606, and founded their first convent outside the walls
of Manila, in the suburb called San Juan de Bagonbayan. They afterward built a convent and church inside the walls, under
the advocacy of St. Nicholas of Tolentino, which is the capital of their religious province. In the province of Tondo they
have the convent and ministry of San Sebasti&aacute;n. In the jurisdiction and port of Cavite, they have a church and convent without

<h3 class="label">Chapter VIII</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the convents and hospitals of the reverend fathers of St. John of God</h3>
<p>The Order of St. John of God arrived at these islands in the year 1641. Their religious founded their first hospital outside
the Manila walls, in the village of Bagonbayan. In the year 1656, it was removed inside the city of Manila, as soon as there
was an opportunity for them in the place where they are at present&#8212;which had before been a hospital begun by the reverend
Franciscan fathers, and aided by the alms given by the brothers of the Santamesa<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2525src" href="#xd0e2525">4</a> and other pious inhabitants. The hospital brethren had the Franciscans&#8217; old church&#8212;which was of good appearance, although
the hospital was very dilapidated and threatened to fall&#8212;until the year 1726, when the very reverend father Fray Antonio de
Arce came to these islands, as prelate and superior of the order. By his energy, economy, prudence, and zeal, the church and
hospital are now seen to be restored and built anew from the foundations, in an elegant and tasteful manner, as well as the
convent and dwelling of the religious. Those works were commenced in the year 1728, with the alms of the pious inhabitants
of the city of Manila; and in the year 1749, when I was in that city, I saw them finished and completed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the village of San Roque, outside the Cavite walls, those same religious had another hospital, the land of which was encroached
upon by the sea until they had to abandon it. In the said year 1749, when I was also in that port, the religious had their
sick in a private house, in which they exercised their ministries, until God our Lord provided them with a hospital by means
of a benefactor who desired to co&ouml;perate in a work of so great importance and mercy. Although they had no hospital in Ceb&uacute;,
while I was there, there was one religious, who had charge of the poor sick people, in a low apartment, or room above the
ground-floor of the episcopal residence. As the land is so poor there, it is very difficult to found and preserve a hospital;
and more so since scarcely a Spanish inhabitant of importance is to be found there now, for the reasons that were given in
the proper place.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2531src" href="#xd0e2531">5</a>

<h3 class="label">Chapter IX</h3>
<h3 class="normal">General summary of the Christians who compose the ministries of these islands</h3>
<p>I do not doubt that the souls ministered to throughout the islands of this archipelago, by the secular and regular priests,
will exceed one million and many thousands additional, inasmuch as the children who are not yet seven years old are not found
mentioned or enumerated in the registers [<i>padrones</i>] of the ministries. Consequently, I shall give attention only to the reckoning made a few years ago.

</p>
<p>The ministries corresponding to those souls are first, as I have written, those of the venerable clerics, who have sixteen
beneficed curacies, in the archbishopric of Manila; in the bishopric of Ceb&uacute;, fifteen; in that of Camarines, eighteen; and
in that of Cagay&aacute;n, four. Consequently, the clerics have fifty-three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>beneficed curacies, in the archbishopric of Manila and the three suffragan bishoprics. In them there are, according to the
best reckoning, one hundred and forty-two villages, besides the visitas, collections of huts [<i>rancher&iacute;as</i>], and missions. This year of 1750 the Christians therein are reckoned at one hundred and forty-seven thousand two hundred
and sixty-nine.

</p>
<p>The calced Augustinian religious have charge of two hundred and fifty-two thousand nine hundred and sixty-three souls, in
one hundred and fifteen villages. The order of the seraphic father, St. Francis, of one hundred and forty-one thousand one
hundred and ninety-three souls, in sixty-three villages. The Society of Jesus, of two hundred and nine thousand five hundred
and twenty-seven Christians, in ninety-three ministries. The Order of St. Dominic, ninety-nine thousand seven hundred and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>eighty souls, in fifty-one regular villages, without counting the visitas and missions. The Recollect religious of St. Augustine
have charge of fifty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-four souls, in one hundred and five villages. Consequently, in
five hundred and sixty-nine regular villages, not counting visitas, groups of huts, and missions, nine hundred and four thousand
one hundred and sixteen Christians are ministered to in all these Filipinas Islands, as will be seen from the subjoined table.

</p>
<p>In regard to the royal tributes, which the natives pay annually, although no fixed computation is possible because of their
difference from year to year (notwithstanding the number which seems to me more regular and fixed from one year to another),
on the hypothesis of the number of souls (the children who are not eligible for the list, as they have not reached the age
of seven years, not being reckoned), and allowing five persons for each whole tribute&#8212;on that hypothesis, I say that the whole
tributes which are collected in these islands amount to two hundred and fifty thousand, at two persons to each tribute who
are eligible to be listed and of age sufficient to pay. That age is for married men fifteen years, and for single men twenty;
for married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>women twenty, and for single women twenty-five; and until each, whether man or woman, has completed the age of sixty years.

</p>
<p>The appraisal of the tribute, according to the laws of these kingdoms, is at ten Castilian reals&#8212;part in kind and part in
silver, or more commonly in what the Indian chooses to pay. Rice is received for it, each fanega of which is valued at one
real in silver among the Tag&aacute;ls, because of its greater abundance. It had the same price among the Visayas, where it was abundant;
and, where it was not abundant, two reals. Five or six years ago, on account of representations made to the supreme government
by the superiors of the religious orders, of the extreme poverty that the Indians were suffering because of the severe <i>baguios</i> and tempests&#8212;which had ruined their houses, fields, and cocoa plantations, and even the churches and the houses of the ministers&#8212;an
order was issued by the said supreme government for rice, to be received in Visayas at the price of three reals per fanega,
which is the lowest among the natives. They also pay as tribute white abac&aacute; mantas, which are called <i>medri&ntilde;aques</i>, four brazas long and one wide, valued at three reals; and also abac&aacute; in fiber, at the rate of two reals per <i>chinanta</i>, which is one-half arroba. That abac&aacute; is used to whip the strands of cables of the ships and boats instead of hemp. They
also pay lampotes, a kind of white cotton fabric, four brazas long and one vara wide, at four reals. In Ilocos they present
thick mantas of cotton, which are called <i>ilocanas</i>, of which are made the sails for the ships and boats, both of his Majesty and of private persons. In other provinces, the
natives offer on the tribute account certain products <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>(of which the alcaldes-mayor avail themselves) such as balates and sigay, and other products which are explained in their
place; and these are valued at Manila, if there are champans from China and pataches from the coast. For the balate (although
we do not eat it), is eaten in China by the princes and mandarins. The sigay (which means certain shells that are gathered
on the shore) is the money and coin that is current on the coast of Bengala and all those Mediterranean kingdoms. The natives
give wax also in place of money, at the rate of ten or twelve reals per chinanta, according to its scarcity or abundance.
Some gold is paid in certain provinces, as those regions have placers and mineral deposits.

</p>
<p>The two hundred and fifty thousand tributes which I mentioned are collected annually throughout these islands, and are divided
into two parts&#8212;one of the royal encomienda, which amounts to two hundred and thirty-one thousand five hundred and sixty-three
whole tributes; while the remaining eighteen thousand four hundred and thirty-seven are from the encomiendas of private persons,
whom his Majesty has rewarded on account of their useful services, granting to them that part of the royal tributes. But,
from those tributes granted them, they give his Majesty two reals per whole tribute, that sum being called &#8220;the royal situado.&#8221;
They also pay to the ministers and parish priests, from their encomiendas, the stipends of rice with the alms in reals that
belong to them&#8212;to the amount of one hundred pesos, and two hundred fanegas of rice, for every five hundred tributes administered,
and one-half real from each whole tribute for the wine used in the mass. His Majesty pays the same quantity to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>the said ministers from his royal encomiendas; he also gives annually one arroba of wine for masses, and ten of oil for each
one of the lamps which burn before the most holy sacrament, in all the ministries of the islands.

</p>
<p>The stipends given by his Majesty to the archbishops and suffragan bishops, the dignitaries of the holy church, and other
ministers are in the following form. Pope Gregory XIII, by his bull given at Roma in the seventh year of his pontificate (which
was the year 1587 [<i>i.e.</i>, 1578]), at the petition of the Catholic king of the Espa&ntilde;as, Don Felipe Second, erected the first parish church of Manila,
and assigned twenty-seven prebends to it, of which those that are suitable and necessary were accepted. They consist of five
dignidades&#8212;namely, a dean, an archdeacon, a precentor, a schoolmaster, and a treasurer; three canons, the fourth having been
suppressed for the inquisitors, according to custom in the Indias; two whole and two half racions, established by royal decree
given at Valladolid, June 2, 1604, and countersigned by Juan Ibarra, his Majesty&#8217;s secretary. Besides that, there are in the
cathedral two curas, two sacristans, one master of ceremonies, one verger, and other officers; so that that holy church is
well established and the choir crowded, and their functions and feasts are most splendid.

</p>
<p>The salaries given by his Majesty to those who fill those offices are as follows. To the archbishops of Manila, five thousand
pesos of eight Castilian reals per year, conceded by decree of his Majesty given in Madrid, May 28, 1680. By virtue of the
royal presentations, the dean enjoys six hundred pesos; the four dignidades, namely, archdeacon, precentor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>schoolmaster, and treasurer, each five hundred pesos; the three canons, namely, the doctoral, the magistral, and that of grace,
four hundred pesos apiece; the two racioneros, three hundred apiece, and the two medio-racioneros, two hundred apiece; the
master of ceremonies, two hundred pesos, conceded by royal decree of February 22, 1724; the two curas, one for the Spaniards,
and one for the natives, each one hundred and eighty-three pesos, six tomins, seven granos, besides their altar-fees, which
are sufficiently generous.

</p>
<p>The bishop of Ceb&uacute;&#8212;whose extensive jurisdiction includes the islands of Ceb&uacute;, Leyte, S&aacute;mar, and Ibabao; the provinces of Dapitan
and Caraga in Mindanao; the island of Panay, with its two provinces of Ot&oacute;n and C&aacute;piz; with the other adjacent islands even
as far as Calamianes, Paragua, and the Marianas&#8212;enjoy four thousand pesos per year, by virtue of a royal decree of May 28,
1680; the cura of the sacristy of that holy church one hundred and eighty-three pesos, six tomins, seven granos; the sacristan,
ninety-one pesos, seven tomins, three granos. The same sums are enjoyed by the bishops of Camarines and Cagay&aacute;n, with their
curas and sacristans. Those sums are paid annually by his Majesty, the amount totaling twenty-three thousand and eleven pesos,
two granos, besides the stipends, maintenance, and fourths of mass-fees, which the other secular curas receive.

<div class="div2" id="xd0e2669">
<h3 class="label">Chapter XIV</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the ecclesiastical tribunals of these Filipinas Islands and the city of Manila</h3>
<p>The chief tribunal of the metropolitan church of Manila is the archiepiscopal. It is composed of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>provisor and vicar-general, with his notary-in-chief and fiscals. The said tribunal has a house which serves as a prison,
and which has a separate and large part for lodgings for the seclusion of men and women; it has its corresponding officials.

</p>
<p>The second tribunal is that of the holy Inquisition, which was decreed by the Holy Office of M&eacute;xico. It is the superior of
all the commissaries who are scattered through the provinces of Ceb&uacute;, Camarines, Cagay&aacute;n, and the islands of Negros&#8212;besides
whom there is in Manila another and special commissary for the fathers of the Society of Jesus, who is generally an honored
secular priest. The commissary has his chief constable and notary. The councils are formed of various ministers&#8212;examiners,
familiars, and consultors. There are besides three or four commissaries appointed by M&eacute;xico, in order that there may be one
who may promptly succeed to the office in case of death or resignation&#8212;although the said duty is always exercised by only
one. That office has always been in control of the reverend fathers of St. Dominic, successively, without other interruption
than that of seven years, when the reverend father Fray Jos&eacute; Paternina, an Augustinian, occupied it&#8212;who was summoned to M&eacute;xico,
as will be seen in due time.

</p>
<p>The third tribunal is that of the Holy Crusade, whose creation was the work of King Don Felipe IV [<i>sic</i>; <i>sc.</i> III], as appears from his royal decree, dated San Lorenzo, May 16, 1609. It is composed of a commissary-general-subdelegate,
who exercises the office of president and who is appointed by his Majesty, with the consent of the supreme council of the
Holy Crusade; and a senior auditor of the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>Audiencia and the fiscal of the same body who receive a special salary for those offices for the management of the accounts.
As accountant serves the oldest royal official, according to the terms of the above cited royal provision. For the other business,
there are a secretary and a chief notary who receive salaries, besides four other notaries who receive no salary, but only
the fees for business transacted by them. The publications in these islands are made every two years. The day fell at the
beginning on October 28, but since 1736 the publication was transferred to the first Sunday of Advent, by order of the commissary-general,
so that the publications might occur at the same time in all the kingdoms and seigniories of Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>The brotherhood of the Santa Misericordia of Manila forms another tribunal composed of the flower of the community. It has
its purveyor, twelve deputies, one secretary, one chaplain, and other officials. In their charge is the administration of
the charitable funds which are connected with that holy institution. The Misericordia was erected in imitation of the one
founded in Lisboa in 1498 by the most serene queen of Portugal, Do&ntilde;a Leonor, widow of Don Juan the Second, by the advice of
a Trinitarian religious, named Fray Miguel de Contreras. The circumstances attending that foundation will be given later.

</p>
<p>The first brothers built a church with the title of &#8220;Presentaci&oacute;n de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora&#8221; [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Presentation of our Lady&#8221;], and near it the seminary and house of Santa Isabel, in order that Spanish orphan girls might
be reared there with a good education in doctrine and morals. They have a rectoress to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span> govern them, a portress, and several virtuous women of mature years. Thence go forth the girls with sufficient dowries for
the estate [of marriage] to which they naturally tend&#8212;for which this Santa Misericordia applies the sum of sixteen thousand
pesos. The girls attending the seminary usually number sixty, besides some pupils, six slave women, and other serving-women.
For their expenses and that of their chaplains ten thousand eight hundred pesos are set aside annually. Many of the inhabitants
and people of the community send their daughters to that seminary, so that they may learn good morals, because of the great
improvement that is recognized in those who have been reared there. The said congregation is governed by special rules, whose
observance does not impose the obligation of mortal sin.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2699src" href="#xd0e2699">6</a> It enjoys many privileges, indulgences, and favors conceded by the supreme pontiffs. By his Majesty&#8217;s decree, dated Sevilla,
March 25, 1733, and countersigned by Don Miguel de Villanueva, his Majesty&#8217;s secretary, it is under the royal protection.
In that decree the royal arms are ordered to be placed in the church and seminary. The brothers are ordered to go out in a
body to make the stations on holy Thursday, and entire faith is to be given in all the tribunals to the instruments of the
secretaries of that holy executive board. The charitable works administered by that holy executive board are numerous; for,
besides the support and rearing of the girls, it maintains the hospital of St. John of God, of the city of Manila, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>generous alms. It may be said that there is no estate that does not experience its charity; for it spends annually in alms
and charitable works alone, more than seventy thousand pesos for the relief of poor, self-respecting Spaniards, for those
who are imprisoned, and for masses for the souls in purgatory&#8212;in such manner that from the year 1600 until the present one
of 1751, in which this history is written, the alms that have been administered by that holy executive board exceed five million
pesos, in addition to the supplements which it has made to the general fund of these islands in cases of extreme necessity,
and at the invasions of enemies, which amounted between the years 1645 and 1735 to the sum of one million sixty-nine thousand
and ninety-nine pesos. Besides the above that holy executive board is patron of twenty-nine collative and ten lay chaplaincies,
and maintains two fellowships in the royal college of San Jos&eacute;.

</p>
<p>There are other charitable institutions in this community, although none so universal and large. They have been founded in
the cathedral church, in the tertiary order of the seraphic order [of St. Francis], in the convent of Dilao, in that of Binondo
of St. Dominic and in their beaterio, in the convent of the calced Augustinian fathers, and in that of the discalced Augustinians.
The Society of Jesus also administers some charitable funds, of which the proceeds are applied by their founders to various
purposes of divine worship, alms for the orders and the poor, dowries for poor Spanish girls, Indian and mestizo women, hospitals,
prisons, and suffrages for the blessed souls in purgatory.

</p>
<p>There is another royal seminary in the city of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>Manila. It was established in the year 1591, while Don Fray Domingo de Salazar was bishop, and Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as governor,
in certain houses given for its foundation by Captain Luis de Vivanco, ex-factor of the royal treasury. It has its own church,
whose titular is St. Andrew the apostle. It was intended for the rearing of orphan girls&#8212;the daughters of Spaniards&#8212;in good
education and virtue. They are under the royal patronage, and his Majesty has the care of maintaining the students, and supplying
them with all necessities. They also admit some pupils, serving-women, and women in retreat. A separate quarter was built
later for the latter, at the expense of Licentiate Don Francisco G&oacute;mez de Arcellano [<i>sc.</i> Arellano], archdeacon of Manila and provisor of the archbishopric. It has its rectoress and portress, and they live with
great edification and holy customs.

<p>The city of Manila has a rich and beautiful chapel of the incarnation of our Lady, which was founded by Governor Don Sebasti&aacute;n
Hurtado de Corcuera, where the functions are performed and the feast-days celebrated that are peculiar to the royal Audiencia.
It serves also for the burial of the soldiers of the army, and the ministrations for the royal hospital. Its chaplains are
independent of the parish church and wear the cope and carry the uplifted cross, when they go for the corpses of the soldiers,
which they bury with all solemnity in the said royal chapel. It has its own chaplain-in-chief and other subordinates, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>who, besides serving there, fill the chaplaincies of the galleons and armies, when there are any. It has its sacristans and
other assistants for the service, propriety, and pomp of the worship; and a fine band of singers, with suitable salaries.
The adornment, furnishings, ornaments, sacred vessels, altars, and reredoses correspond to the reality of the name. Among
all those things, the first place is given to a great golden monstrance which is worth eleven thousand ducados.

</p>
<p>The royal hospital is located near the royal chapel. The soldiers of the army of Manila and the seamen of his Majesty&#8217;s service
are treated there. It has a chaplain, superintendent, physician, surgeon, apothecary, and other followers with similar duties,
and the employees required for the care and refreshment of the sick.

</p>
<p>There is another royal seminary and college in this city that bears the title of San Felipe. It was founded in the time of
Governor Don Fausto Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora, to whom an order, dated November 28, 1697, was given in a royal decree, to report how
the said college or seminary could be founded, so that some boys might be reared there for the cathedral service. The said
governor having reported, his Catholic Majesty, Don Felipe V, determined, by his royal decree of April 28, 1702,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2741src" href="#xd0e2741">7</a> to erect the college for eight seminarists. The amount of its building and maintenance was to be taken from the funds resulting
from vacant sees of bishops of these islands and from the tithes, while the part lacking was to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>taken from the royal treasury. The archbishop of Manila was to have part in everything, and he was to inform his Majesty of
what should be done. The royal decree having been carried out, while the master-of-camp Don Diego Camacho y Avila was governing,
it appears that four thousand pesos were paid by general council of the treasury, held May 22, 1705, for the building. Full
notice will be given of the events connected with that seminary and royal college in the body of this history.

coast of the island was established the city and original colony of the Spaniards; but today it has become so depopulated
that it has hardly enough citizens to fill the offices that pertain to a city, as are those of regidors and alcaldes-in-ordinary;
and <i>not</i> seldom has it occurred that some Spaniards must be conveyed thither to supply the lack of people, going in place of these
who died.... At present, the city is reduced to the church and convent of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, the church and residence of the
Society of Jesus (a building which, although small, is very regular and well planned), and, midway between them, the cathedral&#8212;which
is very inferior to those two churches, since it consists only of a large apartment thatched with palm-leaves. (The foundations
were laid, however, for another and more suitable building, in the time when the diocese was governed by the illustrious bishop
Doctor Don Manuel Antonio de Ocio y Ocampo [who entered that office in 1733]; but his death prevented him from completing
the work, and it has remained in that condition ever since.) The royal building is well arranged and sufficiently capacious,
serving as palace for the commander of the Pintados fleets; he is also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2540" href="#xd0e2540">164n</a>]</span>warder of a good stone fortress (triangular in shape) and commander of the port, and at the same time alcalde and chief magistrate
of the entire province&#8212;which includes the islands of Ceb&uacute;, Bohol, Siquijor, and a great part of the coast of Mindanao, with
other smaller and adjacent islands.

</p>
<p class="footnote">&#8220;The cause for the city&#8217;s being depopulated, at present, of Spanish inhabitants is nothing else than the cupidity of some
persons who came from Manila to the government of the province with appointments as alcaldes, whose greed did not allow any
partnership, in spite of the oath that they take not to carry on trade, either in person or through another person, within
the limits of their jurisdiction. These are indeed lands where no one can live without barter or trading; for not one of the
Spaniards applies himself to cultivating the soil, nor do they have fixed incomes from the country with which to meet their
obligations. Moreover, they have to buy whatever they need, with either commodities or money; accordingly, if the alcaldes-mayor
forbid the inhabitants (as they do) from going out through the province to buy what they need, the latter find themselves
in Ceb&uacute; in the condition of one who is shut up in a prison, where no one can search for or find him. If vessels arrive to
sell their merchandise the alcalde-mayor, near whose house they anchor, is the one who first avails <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2544" href="#xd0e2544">165n</a>]</span>himself of everything&#8212;either for his own use, or to sell the goods again&#8212;leaving for the rest of the people only what is of
no use to himself. If any one has energy enough to press forward to purchase what he needs, he is immediately threatened with
imprisonment, seizure of his goods, flogging, and the loss of everything from which any profit was expected&#8212;as I have many
times seen, because I lived several years in that country, where only recourse to God is near, or to superiors who are very
far away. This is the reason why the Spanish residents have withdrawn from Ceb&uacute;, to avoid continual quarrels and annoyances&#8212;going
to Manila, where they can live with greater peace and quietness, although not so profitably, on account of the choice commodities
which they could obtain in the Visayan provinces for the increase of their wealth. The only ones who remain and bear the heavy
yoke are the mestizos and Sangleys, who always have to share with the alcalde what they seek out with their toil and hardship,
if they wish to live without unrest and fear. Sometimes, but rarely, the alcaldes share with these people that which might
bring them some profit; but usually they furnish the commodities which they bring from Manila, at the very highest prices,
receiving in exchange those of the provinces at the lowest and most paltry rates.&#8221;

<p>[The French scientist Le Gentil, in his <i lang="fr">Voyages dans les mers de l&#8217;Inde</i> (Paris, 1781), pp. 170&#8211;191, speaks as follows of the ecclesiastical estate of the Philippines.]



</p>

<h3 class="label">Ninth Article</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Ecclesiastical survey of the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>The first church in Manila was erected as a parish church in the year 1571, and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. The
Augustinians and the discalced Franciscans had charge of it until 1581, when the first bishop arrived. Gregory XIII, by a
bull, dated Rome, 1578, erected the parish church of Manila into a cathedral, and Philippe II, king of Espa&ntilde;a, established
the chapter. It is composed of five dignitaries&#8212;dean, archdeacon, orecentor, schoolmaster [<i>&eacute;col&acirc;tre</i>],<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2765src" href="#xd0e2765">1</a> and treasurer&#8212;two whole prebendaries; two half prebendaries<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2768src" href="#xd0e2768">2</a> two parish priests [<i>cur&eacute;s</i>]; sacristans; master of ceremonies; and beadle. The divine office is celebrated in this cathedral with great state and majesty.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>The archbishop receives 5,000 piastres<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2783src" href="#xd0e2783">3</a> (25,500 livres); the dean, 600 (3,030 livres); archdeacon, schoolmaster, precentor, and treasurer, each 500 (2,525 livres);
the three canons&#8212;namely, the doctoral, the magistral, and the one of grace or favor&#8212;and the two half prebendaries, each 400
(2,020 livres); the master of ceremonies, 1,200 livres; and last, the two parish priests [<i>cures</i>], each 924 livres.

</p>
<p>The fixed revenue of these parish priests is, as one can see, very little, but they have a little in perquisites, as marriages,
baptisms, etc. Not more than forty years ago, one of the two parish priests had charge of the Spaniards, while the other attended
only to the Indians. Today this ridiculous distinction no longer exists. The parish priests alternate month by month in their
duties as curates, and during that time they minister indiscriminately to Spaniards and Indians.

</p>
<p>The cathedral of Manila was erected into a metropolitan in 1595. The bishoprics of Zebu, Camarin&eacute;s, and Nueva S&eacute;govia are
of the same date, and were made suffragan to Manila. This archbishopric has more than two hundred livings, of which only thirteen
are served by secular priests&#8212;who are subject, say the friars, to visitation; the other livings, to the number of about two
hundred, are administered by the religious, who, as they say, are not at all subject to the visitation of the archbishop.
We shall discuss this subject and the rebellion occasioned by this matter in Manila in 1767, while I was still there.

<h3 class="label">Tenth Article</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the ecclesiastical tribunals established at Manila</h3>
<p>These tribunals are three in number: that of the archbishop; that of the Inquisition; and that of the Holy Crusade.

</p>
<p>The tribunal of justice of the archbishop is composed of a vicar-general, one notary, and two fiscals. The archbishop has
his prison, where there are lodgings for lewd women.

</p>
<p>There is not, properly speaking, a tribunal of the Inquisition at Manila, but only a commissary of the Holy Office, appointed
to this place by the tribunal of Mexico. He is the chief or superior of all the other commissaries scattered throughout the
provinces. It is worthy of remark that the fathers of the Society had a private and special commissary, who was always a secular
priest. The office of commissary-superintendent has always been filled in the convent of the Jacobins [<i>i.e.</i>, Dominicans]. There has been only one interruption, of seven years, during which a father of the convent of the Augustinians
had the commission, because the Jacobin father who was then commissary was deposed, as we were told, for having unjustly brought
suit against the governor of Manila, and having had him arrested.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2808src" href="#xd0e2808">4</a>

</p>
<p>At present these commissaries have no right to bring suit against anyone at all, nor even to cause any arrest. They are under
obligation to write to Mexico, in order to inform the tribunal of charges <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>and accusations. Thereupon the tribunal renders a sentence, which it sends to the commissary, who has it executed. That sentence
comprehends arrest. Thereupon the commissary causes the arrest of the accused person, and ships him to Mexico. The trial is
conducted there, and the accused is sent back to Manila for the execution of the sentence, if there is cause therefor.

</p>
<p>The tribunal of the Holy Crusade has nothing especially deserving that I should stop to mention it.

<h3 class="label">Eleventh Article</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Which contains details in regard to the churches and colleges of Manila</h3>
<p>Next to the cathedral of which I have just spoken, must be reckoned the royal chapel. It is used for all the feast-days and
ceremonies of the royal Audiencia. It has in charge the spiritual administration of the royal hospital of his Majesty&#8217;s soldiers;
it is their parish church, and they are buried there. This chapel has a chaplain, who is, as it were, the rector. He has five
other chaplains under him, besides sacristans and assistants. The divine office is celebrated there with great state. The
royal chapel furnishes chaplains for the galleons. The royal hospital, which is located quite near by, has its chaplain, its
administrator, its physician, its surgeon, its apothecary, and everything necessary.

</p>
<p>Formerly the royal seminary of San Felipe, composed of eight seminarists and one rector, was located at Manila; theology and
the arts were taught there. These two chairs have been suppressed, and those who wish to avail themselves of the schools go
to the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s. Since the war this seminary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>no longer exists; that is to say, it is no longer maintained, so that it amounts to the same thing. Its annual expenses were
paid from the royal revenues, so that its maintenance depended absolutely upon the good-will of the governor. For that reason,
I saw it, in 1767, without support. That lasted after the war, which caused great outcry at Manila against the governor. The
archbishop was never able to succeed in re&euml;stablishing it, although he contended that a seminary was very useful in this capital.
But the religious took the opportunity to oppose it secretly, for, as they wish to extend their authority, the fewer the priests
who can be trained in the archbishopric, the more need will there be of religious to serve the curacies.

</p>
<p>In 1717, the king caused three persons to go to Manila, in order to teach the institutes and laws there; and assigned them
the suitable incomes, namely, one thousand piastres (5,050 livres). These three persons took one of the largest houses in
Manila, and in fact, began to teach there; but they generally had no scholars. The royal Audiencia represented to the king
that since there were two universities at Manila, those three posts were useless, since the same branches could be taught
in the universities. Consequently, the king had to pay four places instead of three, for it was necessary to establish a chair
of canon law and another of the institutes in the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, and the same in the university of the fathers
of the Society.

</p>
<p>The seminary of Sancta Potenciana was established in 1591; it served for young girls bereft of father and mother, who were
reared and instructed there at the expense of the king. They had a mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>superior, a chaplain, and a portress. The building of this seminary having fallen into ruins, Archbishop Roxo proposed to
rebuild it, but the English prevented him from doing so. The bombs and bullets having finished its destruction, its pensioners
were transferred to Santa Isabela. Santa Isabela is a sort of house or seminary designed for the rearing of young Spanish
girls and orphans. The church is dedicated to the Presentation of our Lady.

</p>
<p>That church and that house are dependent on a confraternity called the Brotherhood of La Misericordia, founded in 1594, on
the model of that founded in Lisboa, in 1498, by Queen L&eacute;onore, widow of Jean [<i>i.e.</i>, Jo&atilde;o] II, who died in 1495. That confraternity is composed of persons of the richest families in Manila, and has a manager,
twelve deputies, one chaplain, and some officers who take charge of affairs. The revenues of La Misericordia are immense.
They all come from legacies which zealous citizens have left, successively, for employment in charitable works. Now these
funds grow and increase considerably every year, for the confraternity invest them by furnishing moneys for the voyage to
Acapulco at a very large rate of interest. The cathedral, the third Order of St. Francis,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2839src" href="#xd0e2839">5</a> the Franciscans, the Dominicans, the Augustinians, and the Recollects, have also legacies or charitable funds; but their
funds are insignificant when compared with those of the confraternity. The fathers of the Society also have some.

</p>
<p>All those houses have been thriving for many years on that silver that comes on the galleons, from which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>one may judge of the immense wealth that they enjoy. We will give an idea of it here in the list of the revenues of La Misericordia.
The girls at Santa Isabela have a mother superior and a portress. When they are married, they leave the college with a dowry;
and La Misericordia, in order to dower them, has established a fund of 16,000 piastres (84,000 livres). There were about fifty
girls aided by La Misericordia when I was at Manila. Santa Isabela also receives boarders; and for the expenses of all the
necessary supplies for the support of the orphans, for the domestics, etc., La Misericordia gives 10,700 piastres (56,175
livres). Besides that, that confraternity has disbursed in alms according to a statement that I have seen for the years 1599&#8211;1726,
3,448,506 piastres (181,046,656 livres), which amounts to 142,556 livres of French money per year. Furthermore, La Misericordia
has assisted the public in cases of extreme necessity, and when the city has been threatened by an invasion on the part of
enemies&#8212;as happened in the years 1646, 1650, 1653&#8211;1663, 1668, and 1735. According to an exact account, it has given 1,069,099
piastres (5,612,769 livres). I say nothing of the considerable sum that it furnished in 1762, when the English captured Manila.

</p>
<p>The house of La Misericordia has its peculiar statutes, according to which it is governed. It has many privileges and, above
all, indulgences, which the popes have successively heaped on it. Finally, in 1733, the king took it under his protection.

</p>
<p>One may judge, from the sample, of the wealth of all the convents of Manila, which, during the more than one hundred and fifty
years while they have been established there, have profited from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>money for charitable works, without having diffused it outside.

</p>
<p>The calced Augustinians were the first religious estate to appear at Manila; they went there in 1565. The convent has about
fifty religious, and furnishes laborers to all the provinces where those fathers have livings. They have forty-five or fifty
in the bishopric of Manila alone. The church of the Augustinians is a very beautiful edifice, being built of cut stone. It
has suffered considerably from earthquakes.

</p>
<p>The fathers of the Society went to the Philippines in 1581. Their principal residence was at Manila, and was named the college
of San Ignacio. Those fathers had so prospered in the Philippines that they had eight other residences scattered throughout
the islands. They were the spiritual masters of the Marianas. They had twenty or thirty livings in the archbishopric of Manila.
Monsieur de Caseins<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2856src" href="#xd0e2856">6</a> took them all to Cadiz in 1770, on the &#8220;Santa Rosa,&#8221; except five or six who remained, and whom Don Joseph de Cordova took
with him the following year on the &#8220;Astrea,&#8221; and with whom I journeyed from the isle of France to Cadiz. The Augustinians
have inherited their possessions. The college of San Ignacio is a very beautiful building;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2859src" href="#xd0e2859">7</a> in spite of its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>defects, it is without doubt the best built and the most regular in Manila. The exterior of the church (which fronts on the
Calle Real) offers an order of architecture very rustic, be it understood. The front, by way of retaliation, is frightful,
without order or proportion. The interior of the church is very well planned; but the principal altar, although overloaded
with gildings, does not correspond at all to the building; it is as poorly executed as the front.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2872src" href="#xd0e2872">8</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>There was a university, to which Pope Clement XII had granted, by a brief of December 6, 1735, rights without number. Beside
the college of San Ignacio is that of San Jose; it was founded in 1585, by Felipe II, for the teaching of Latin. But since
the existence of the two universities, that college is almost deserted.

</p>
<p>The marquis de Ovando<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2884src" href="#xd0e2884">9</a>&#8212;to whom navigation owes so much at Manila, as I have said&#8212;having seen that there was no attention paid to navigation in the
center of two universities (although those universities <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>were in a maritime and commercial city), founded a chair of mathematics in 1750, for the utility and progress of navigation.
He died in 1754, and his school died with him. As long as he lived it maintained its standing, but after him it declined;
in 1767 that school was no longer frequented. Manila gets the pilots for its galleons from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>The Dominicans went to Manila in 1587, in order to found a mission there. They have a fine convent, with about thirty religious.
Their university dates from 1610. The Dominicans have only a dozen livings in the archbishopric of Manila.

</p>
<p>The college of San Juan de Letran owes its institution to a Spaniard of singularly exemplary life, who took charge of the
orphan children of the Spaniards, and those whose fathers and mothers were poor. He supported them and taught them at the
expense of his own income, and when that did not suffice, he collected alms to assist the lack in his own funds. The king,
in order to make it easier for him to exercise his humane acts, gave him an encomienda in the province of Ilocos. At the approach
of old age, he retired into the infirmary of the Dominicans, with the permission of the archbishop, and died there a religious.
He renounced his encomienda, his house, and all his possessions, in due form; and placed them at the disposal of the Dominicans,
on condition that they take charge of the rearing of his orphans. According to the act that was passed June 18, 1640, the
house was erected into a college under the advocacy of St. John of the Letran. The king added to it some revenues from the
royal chapel; and the students who left that college belonged to the king, and had to enter his service, either in the military
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>or otherwise. The Dominicans have gradually changed those rules. The students of that college, to the number of about fifty
who are supported there annually, are all or nearly all destined for the priesthood. Consequently they study philosophy and
theology in the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s.

</p>
<p>Opposite San Juan de Letran, on the other side of the street, stands the royal community of Santa Catalina. It has undergone
various changes since 1695, the year in which it was founded.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2900src" href="#xd0e2900">10</a> The Dominicans had charge of it at first; while now they have a mother superior, they follow, nevertheless, the third Order
of St. Dominic. They have no church of their own, but the college of San Juan de Letran serves them as one. Without celebrating
there any office, they attend mass there, being separated from it by the width of the street, where they have a gallery which
communicates from their cells with the church of San Juan de Letran.

</p>
<p>The Recollects arrived at Manila in 1606. They have built a fine convent there, and so large that two hundred religious could
be very comfortable in it; however, they never have more than forty. They have a dozen livings in the archbishopric of Manila.

</p>
<p>The hospital Order of St. John of God obtained permission from the king in 1627 to send ten religious to Manila. In 1656,
the board of La Misericordia made those fathers a present of their old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>hospital. The king approved that gift, but the hospital has fallen many times. In 1726, the archbishop undertook to reestablish
it, and to rebuild it again on new foundations; and that has been executed. That hospital is a vast and elegant building.
The church is beautiful. The wards for the sick are large, and filled with very comfortable beds, and there are plenty of
religious. Those fathers are very useful in Manila, for they are very charitable to the sick. The Spaniards of Manila and
its environs send their domestics there when they are sick; and they are given especial care, and treated gratis. Those fathers
are, beyond doubt, the most useful in Manila; but, in spite of that, they are poor and often in want. They live only on alms,
and without the Confraternity of La Misericordia that house would find it hard to subsist.

</p>
<p>I shall make here only one reflection, which the love for humanity tears from me. The Confraternity of La Misericordia have
amassed immense wealth, but they scatter and spend it on the unfortunate who are in need: the State itself has often found
aid there. The religious orders also have their treasures, but I have been assured that no one benefits by them; and that,
on the contrary, like those treasures of the Igolotes, their treasures only increase each year. Also the <i lang="fr">Histoire Espagnole</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8221;<i>Spanish History</i>&#8221;], that tells of the employment made by La Misericordia of its charitable contributions, is silent as to what the religious
orders do with theirs.

</p>
<p>The discalced Franciscans went to Manila in 1577. They are allied to the Capuchins.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2928src" href="#xd0e2928">11</a> Their convent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>is superb and immense. They generally have thirty religious, besides fifty others who are nearly religious and who fill a
like number of curacies in the archbishopric of Manila. Inside the convent enclosure is to be seen a fine chapel, where the
holy sacrament is continually kept. That chapel is intended for the exercises of the tertiaries.

</p>
<p>Outside the walls of Manila, and a gunshot from that city, stands the hospital of San Lazaro; the Franciscan religious have
charge of its temporal and spiritual administration. That hospital is for lepers, many of whom are seen in Manila. The Spanish
call that disease <i lang="es">el mal lazaro</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2946src" href="#xd0e2946">12</a>

<h3 class="label">Article Twelve</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the bishops of the Philippines suffragan to Manila; and of the general number of Christian souls in those islands.</h3>
<p>The bishopric of Z&eacute;bu is the first; it was created in 1595. Its cathedral is built of wood, and is quite large; it is dedicated
to St. Michael. It has no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>canons. There is one cura there, one sacristan, one vicar-general, and several priests. The bishop is almost always a religious.
When he officiates, he is generally accompanied by two mestizo [<i>mul&acirc;tres</i>] priests.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2963src" href="#xd0e2963">13</a> Moreover, there is at Z&eacute;bu a convent of calced Augustinians, one of discalced Augustinians or Recollects, one residence of
the Society of Jesus, and one alcalde. There are generally three fathers in each convent, and that is the largest number that
they have ever had. The city of Z&eacute;bu, which ought not to bear the name of city, is a collection of a few miserable straw shacks,
like those of all Indians; the convents, on the contrary, are finely built. The latter are immense buildings, and that for
only two or three persons. That is true of all the convents of the Philippines, which are seven or eight times larger than
are necessary for the number of fathers whom they contain. It remains to ascertain whether that is the case because the number
of religious is at present less in Espa&ntilde;a than it was one hundred and fifty or one hundred and eighty years ago; or whether
those buildings were erected with the expectation and idea that they would some day be peopled and filled. I have been unable
to learn which is correct. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>was a quarter for the Chinese at Z&eacute;bu, as at Manila. The bishop of Z&eacute;bu receives a salary of four thousand piastres (21,000
livres), the cur&eacute;, one hundred and eighty piastres (960 livres), and the sacristan ninety-one (472 livres).

</p>
<p>The bishopric of Camarines dates from the same time as that of Z&eacute;bu, and was founded in the same manner. That city is not
more beautiful than that of Z&eacute;bu. The calced Augustinians, the Recollects, and the discalced Franciscans are established at
Camarines.

</p>
<p>The bishopric of Nueva Segovia was founded at the same time and in the same manner as the preceding. The city (if it is one)
has a convent of calced Augustinians, one of discalced Franciscans, and one of Dominicans.

</p>
<p>The secular priests, according to a list that I have seen, govern one hundred and forty-two livings, which include 131,279
persons. The other livings, to the number of more than five hundred and fifty, are divided among the Augustinians, the fathers
of the Society, the Dominicans, the Recollects, and the discalced Franciscans.

</p>
<p>The above sum is for 1735, and is very exact, as it is taken from the communities and from the statement of the royal officials.
There may, however, be some error in it, due to the fact that the Indians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>change their dwelling from time to time, or absent themselves for some time. Mortality must also have some effect on it. It
results always that the natives of the Philippines, the subjects of the king of Espa&ntilde;a, form a colony about as numerous as
the city of Paris; and that that colony, if it were well governed and well directed, might become very flourishing.

<div class="div2" id="xd0e3022">
<h3 class="label">Article Thirteenth</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the power and influence enjoyed by the religious in the Philippines</h3>
<p>If the governor of the Philippines is absolute, the religious orders form there a body that is not less powerful. Masters
of the provinces, they govern there, one might say, as sovereigns; they are so absolute that no Spaniard dares go to establish
himself there. If he tried to do so, he would succeed only after having surmounted great difficulties, and removed the greatest
obstacles. But he would always be at swords&#8217; point: the friars would play him so many tricks; they would seek so many occasions
of dispute with him; and they would stir up so many things against him, that in the end he would be forced to go away. Thus
do those fathers remain masters of the land, and they are more absolute in the Philippines than is the king himself.

</p>
<p>In 1763 or 1764 an alcalde of Manila, zealous for the public welfare, had a royal road lengthened two or three leagues from
the city, and had both sides of it planted with trees. It produced a very beautiful effect, and facilitated the carriage of
food to Manila. The fathers of the Society began a suit against the alcalde, because, they said, he had encroached upon the
lands of the poor Indians. The alcalde, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>rightfully, paid but little attention to the suit. The fathers of the Society, upon seeing that the matter was not turning
out at all to their advantage, caused the trees to be cut down by the Indians, and reduced the road to its former condition&#8212;that
is to say, they administered justice themselves. Will it be believed that the affair is left in this condition? However, nothing
is more certain; it was still quite recent at my arrival at Manila, and was related to me by several persons worthy of credit.

</p>
<p>According to an ordinance of the king, renewed, perhaps, a hundred times, the religious are ordered to teach Castilian to
the young Indians. But his Majesty, the Spaniards of Manila have assured me universally, has not yet been obeyed to this day,
and has not been able to succeed in having the ordinance executed. Public schools are to be seen at a half-league&#8217;s distance
from Manila, where the youth are taught, but good care is taken not to teach them Castilian. They are taught the language
of the country. They have, it is true, little prayer-books written in Castilian, and the youth are taught now and then a few
words of that language; but the chief language that the teachers try to have them speak and read well is the language of their
own country. So, go one league from Manila, and you can scarcely be understood if you do not know the language of the country&#8212;a
fact which I can attest, for I have experienced it. It is still worse in the provinces. Thus are the friars the masters of
the Indians. A great abuse that follows from that is, that the Spaniards themselves cannot get any knowledge of the condition
of things in those provinces. They would have no safety in traveling, if they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>not known to the religious, and if they did not have with them recommendations presented by the religious of Manila. Those
recommendations are infinitely more to be preferred than the orders which the governor could give to the alcaldes or to those
religious. The latter would probably not deign to receive them; while the alcaldes, who themselves need to keep on good terms
with the friars, would give but faint response to the governor&#8217;s orders.

</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the recommendations possible, it yet happens that the friar in charge of the people among whom you travel,
allows you but rarely to speak alone with the Indians. When you speak in his presence to any Indian who understands a little
Castilian, if that religious is displeased to have you converse too long with that native he makes him understand, in the
language of the country, not to answer you in Castilian but in his own language. The Indian obeys him; and, if you are not
aware of that practice, you cannot guess his reason, inasmuch as you have not understood what the religious said. I have been
assured of this by several Spaniards, among them the engineer Don F&eacute;liciano Marqu&egrave;s. He has several times complained to me
that, in spite of his great desire to travel in the provinces, he did not dare resolve to do it, in view of the great difficulties
that he saw to be inseparable from such an undertaking.

</p>
<p>We went together, he and I, several times, on the river in a <i>pangue</i>&#8212;the boat of the country. Once we went up stream for three leguas. No one could understand us at that short distance from
Manila, for no one knew any Castilian; neither did they even pay any attention to us. One would not believe that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>Spaniards were the masters of the country. That, I was told by the Spaniards, was the result and the effect of the policy
of the friars.

</p>
<p>If the religious in the Philippines have resisted the temporal power in these matters, they have not been more docile, in
another matter, to the ecclesiastical power; for they have been able, even to this day, to elude the visitation of the archbishops,
and those prelates have never been able to succeed in that.

</p>
<p>The great obstacle in this matter is, that there are very few [secular] priests in the Philippines, and the majority of those
who are there are Indians. The people, say the Spaniards, have almost no respect or veneration for the latter. Most frequently
they are dressed like their compatriots, the other Indians, in the fashion of the country. The friars, on the contrary, are
necessarily more respected, and even though it were only by reason of their mode of dress, they would inspire more awe in
the people than do the Indian priests. Those religious hold the people in a sort of dependence in which the priests of their
own race, and clad as they, could not hold them. But so the religious, because they know that they are necessary in the present
condition of affairs, have always raised an opposition when the archbishops have tried to visit them, so that the latter have
never been able to surmount the difficulty. The religious are, so to speak, entrenched or fortified in castles (<i lang="es">encastillados</i>, to use the peculiar expression of the Spaniards), so that all the zeal of the archbishops has been unable to reduce them
to the footing of the other curas. As a rule, there are no difficulties at all in the other bishoprics; for, as the livings
there are almost always filled by religious, the curas easily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>allow themselves to be visited by a person of their own class. It is true that, since the governors have not as yet taken
sides with them, the archbishops have always been the weaker party.

</p>
<p>Monsieur Arandia, of whom I have already spoken, a man fit to govern a state, would have doubtless put an end to it had he
lived. Don Manuel Antonio Roxo was appointed archbishop of Manila under his government. Don Andr&egrave;s Roxo, nephew of that archbishop,
told me several times that Monsieur Arandia was only awaiting his uncle&#8217;s arrival to conclude that important matter. But Arandia
died before his arrival, and it is claimed that he was helped to die. However that may be, Archbishop Roxo, having lost his
support, could not, although he became governor and captain-general of the islands, make the friars submissive. He wrote to
the king that the briefs of the pope and the decrees of his Majesty would always be without force and validity; and that the
one and only way of succeeding in regulating that matter was to issue imperative commands to the general of each order in
Europe to direct their friars at Manila to receive the visit of the archbishop. In the meantime, the war comes&#8212;Manila is captured;
Roxo dies, and all is as before.

</p>
<p>Roxo was replaced only in 1767. That year the court of Espa&ntilde;a sent an archbishop.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3059src" href="#xd0e3059">14</a> I saw him, and even went to make him several visits when he had made his [public] entrance. He wrote to all the communities
that he was preparing to visit his diocese. He had, so it was said, left Europe with the fullest authority for that purpose.
He had bulls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>briefs from the pope, and orders from the court. He thought that he would succeed with all these arms, but he did not know
that there would be an answer for everything at Manila. The friars answered then that they could not allow him to visit them;
and such is their answer [to their superior]. They went, say they, first to the Philippines; they have received the care of
souls, under certain conditions and certain charges that cannot be set aside; [and they said] that the archbishop might, if
he wished, take away all the livings in their charge and provide the same with secular priests. I have said that the archbishopric
of Manila contains more than two hundred livings, of which only thirteen are in charge of secular priests. Consequently, there
are about two hundred still occupied by the friars. Now the case was very embarrassing for the archbishop, who did not then
have two hundred priests at his disposal. As to the briefs, bulls, etc., consider the pleasant response that they made, and
which their partisans scattered abroad in public; they said, then, that his Excellency had not brought any new rulings with
him from the courts of Rome and Madrid. It was very true that there existed a bull of the pope in regard to that matter, but
it would have to be looked for in the books. In order that it might, on the other hand, become a law, it was necessary for
the archbishop to give notification of it, legalized by notary in the ordinary manner. Such, they said, were the laws of the
kingdom, in consideration of the fact that there might be some difference in the books, either by the transposition of a comma,
or by some other error that might have slipped into the printing.

</p>
<p>Such are the intrenchments that the friars opposed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>in 1767 to the new archbishop of Manila. In the beginning, the Dominicans and Augustinians were disturbed; the Dominicans
in fact submitted, and the archbishop&#8217;s party already thought that he had the victory. But, toward the end of the year, some
repented, and changed their minds; and, as a consequence, there was a schism in the convent. The Augustinians also were divided,
and they came even to blows among themselves. One of the chief actors was imprisoned in his room. However, the matter was
arranged, and it was agreed that all of them should assemble and be reconciled, without saying a word of what had occurred.
It produced a singular effect. At my arrival the dissension had again commenced, but I am not aware how the affair terminated.

</p>
<p>The other religious and the fathers of the Society held firm. These last especially, in appearance, were very assiduous in
visiting the governor<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3070src" href="#xd0e3070">15</a>&#8212;and that at an hour when no one is received in the houses of Manila, unless it be for matters which cannot suffer delay;
that is to say, the fathers went just after dinner, at the time when all people retire to take their siesta. Having gone one
day during that time, just after his dinner, to see the governor about a pressing matter which concerned me, scarcely had
I begun what I had to say when a father of the Society appeared, who had ascended by a little private stair-way. I was unable
to terminate my business. The reverend father took possession of the governor, who made an appointment with me for another
time. I cannot be positive that that father had gone on the matter of the visitation; I only report that fact because it agrees
with what was said then at Manila in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>regard to the frequent visits which the fathers of the Society made to the governor, at times when no one dared present himself
at the government [house].

</p>
<p>I must tell what side the governor took in so delicate a matter. On one side he was pressed by the archbishop; on the other
he was solicited by the Jesuits and the friars. During these contests I found him one evening when I went to see him, meditative
and thoughtful. He had two letters in his hand, which the archbishop had written to him, successively, that same day. He told
me, with demonstrations of feeling which showed his embarrassment, that the archbishop was writing to him letter after letter,
on a matter that depended on him in no way at all. He said that he had no instructions on the matter, and that he could not
exceed his powers. And, as he repeated that to me time after time, I answered him that, since he had no orders from his court,
and especially since he had no secular priests at his disposal, it was in fact very difficult for him to proceed as the archbishop
desired. It must be observed that I was living with a wealthy French merchant, one of whose daughters had married the secretary
of the government; and I have often remarked that that secretary was not at all inclined to the archbishop&#8217;s side.

</p>
<p>Next morning, four <i>pasquinades</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e3084src" href="#xd0e3084">16</a> or injurious and very defamatory placards, were found posted in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>the city: one at the government offices; the second, on the gate of the Pari&aacute;n; a third at La Misericordia; and the fourth
at our door. Those lampoons stated distinctly that the governor for twenty thousand piastres (105,000 livres), had prevented
the archbishop from fulfilling his duty. The secretary was beside himself at the boldness of the lampoon, and especially at
the one posted at his door. He spoke of it as a crime which deserved the most severe chastisement. He added that it would
be better for him who had done it, if he were discovered, that he had never lived. In fact, I am quite sure that Sambouangam<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3095src" href="#xd0e3095">17</a> (in the island of Mindanao), which I have before mentioned, would have been his dwelling, and that he would not have enjoyed
himself there very greatly.

</p>
<p>The friars in the Philippines are, as can be seen, absolute in the provinces. It is quite true that, according to the ordinances,
the governor ought to send the auditors there from time to time in the quality of visitors. But besides that that scarcely
ever happens, these visitors, although members of the royal Audiencia, are obliged to take recommendations from the convents
of Manila before their departure, in order to be well received. However, that great authority of the friars over the people
does not prevent the latter from revolting very often in the provinces; and those revolts are nearly always followed by the
death of some religious. Then there is no means of restoring order except by sending troops to reduce the Indians to obedience,
for the eloquence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>of the religious can do nothing. Such an emergency occurred in my time, at the end of 1767. Several settlements about the
large lake revolted, and carried their boldness even to the point of killing the friar curas. It was necessary to send a cavalry
officer at the head of a detachment of fifteen men, to make those rebels submit.

</p>
<p>These disorders always happened when the provinces of the Philippines had at their head, to govern them, only an alcalde and
the friars. I believe that it would be necessary for the court to have four or five hundred troops (or at least a sufficient
number), for the sole purpose of scattering them through those different provinces, in posts of only fifteen or twenty men.
That number, besides being but inconsiderable and of little expense, would be sufficient to maintain the Indians in their
duty, since only fifteen men have appeased the disturbance in a considerable district near the lake.

</p>
<p>[The following, also from Le Gentil (pp. 59&#8211;63), treats in part of the ecclesiastical estate.]

<h3 class="label">Ninth Article</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Of the genius of the inhabitants of the Philippines, and the peculiar punishments inflicted by the religious on the women
who do not attend mass on the prescribed days.
</h3>
<p>This article is the fourteenth chapter of the Franciscan religious from whom I have extracted a portion of my details. But
I believe that it will be important to reproduce here in exact translation the text of the original.

</p>
<p>[The extract is from San Antonio&#8217;s <i>Chronicas</i>, vol. i, part of chapter xl of book i; it is not, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>an exact translation, but in part a synopsis. The meaning is not distorted; but we have preferred to translate this portion
of the chapter, entitled in San Antonio &#8220;Of the characteristics and genius of the Filipino Indians,&#8221; directly from the Spanish,
reproducing exactly the matter synopsized by Le Gentil.]

</p>
<p>&#8220;412. Among the gifts with which man is adorned, those of the soul are the most noble and most important&#8212;for instance, the
characteristics or bent, and the skill or understanding in the exercise of a man&#8217;s reasonings and mental operations. And since
the soul is so dependent on the body and on its sensations, the spiritual operations are tempered by the bodily characteristics.
These characteristics (in the judgment of Galen, Plato, Aristotle, and Hippocrates), are such or such, according to the varying
climate of the [different] regions. Consequently, the difference of nations in bodily characteristics, and in disposition,
genius, and morals, springs from the various climates of the regions, and from the difference in air, water, and food&#8212;in accordance
with that maxim, <i lang="la">Natura facit habilem</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3128src" href="#xd0e3128">18</a> in its common interpretation. That makes evident (in distant regions) the difference between Spaniards and French, Indians
and Germans, Ethiopians and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>English. It is experienced, within distances not so great, in the many provinces of Espa&ntilde;a alone. Even in Ubeda and Ba&egrave;za,
only one legua apart, this diversity of men and women is found. There are more marked differences of this sort encountered
in Philipinas; for there are certain peoples at the mouth of one river, while at the source are others very different in complexion,
customs, and languages. In the same province are found stupid and intelligent peoples; white, black, and brown; and those
of distinct degrees of corpulency, and features according to the various temperatures and climates. It is a matter which is
truly surprising, to see so great a diversity of temperatures and so great a diversity of men within so small a space. But
that happens in districts here and there, for usually there is but little differentiation in these islands in characteristics
and genius. If one Indian be known, I believe that they are all known; but God alone can have this complete knowledge.

</p>
<p>&#8220;413. The very reverend father, Gaspar de San Agustin, an Augustinian and a native of Madrid, with the practical experience
of forty years of life among those people, confesses, in a letter which he wrote concerning their characteristics&#8212;and which
although in manuscript, deserves to be printed, for he understood those natives as far as it is possible to comprehend them&#8212;that
it is so difficult to describe their characteristics that it would be more easy to define the formal object in logic; more
feasible to compute the square of a circle; more discoverable to assign a fixed rule for the measurement of the degrees of
longitude on the globe; and after the four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>knowledges of Solomon could be placed this fifth, as impossible.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3140src" href="#xd0e3140">19</a> In fact, after so many years, he says that he has only been able to understand that <i lang="la">quadraginta annis proximus fui Generationi huic, &amp; dixi: semper hi erant corde</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3149src" href="#xd0e3149">20</a> He speaks at length and from experience and with remarkable detail. Although the letter is worth printing, my lack of space
does not allow me to copy it.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3152src" href="#xd0e3152">21</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;414. Granting, then, as true the experiences that he writes, and reducing them to a brief summary I assert that <i>the character of these Indians is a maze of contradictions and oppositions</i>; and I believe that this is not the worst of the descriptions. For they are at once proud and humble; bold in wickedness,
and pusillanimous cowards; compassionate and cruel; negligent and lazy; but for their own affairs, whether evil or good, careful
and watchful; easily credulous, but incapable of understanding, and fickle, after so oft repeated sacred teachings. They are
very much inclined to attend the church, and its feasts and solemn rites, but it is necessary to oblige them by the rigor
of the lash to attend mass on the prescribed days, and confession and communion when holy Church orders; and are very reverent
toward the ministering fathers because of the superiority that they recognize in them, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>at the same time they mock them, murmur against them, and even deceive them. Consequently, a religious called them jokingly
&#8216;the schoolchildren of St. Casiano;&#8217;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3165src" href="#xd0e3165">22</a> for it is a fact that they go astray in all their resolutions without the government of the fathers, and it is necessary
to treat them like schoolchildren in their instruction.&#8221;

</p>
<p>[Here we resume the narrative of Le Gentil, who italicises the words, &#8220;It is necessary to employ the lash in order to get
them to attend mass on the prescribed days when holy Church orders it, and to treat them as schoolchildren,&#8221; and continues:]

</p>
<p>This is an abuse which reigns in the provinces. The religious give the lash to women and girls with a cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails, even
in the presence of their husbands, and no one dares say a word. That is not practiced at Manila, and the religious are not
so absolute there as they are in the provinces; and, besides, one is able at times not to attend mass on Sunday without that
act of irreligion reaching the ears of the religious or the cur&eacute;s.

</p>
<p>I was intimately acquainted at Manila with some army officers, with whom I had gone from the &Icirc;le de France to that city on
board the &#8220;Bon-conseil.&#8221; Although Spaniards, they dared to revolt publicly against that ridiculous custom; others approved
it. Sometimes the religious or fathers have their own executioners, and the church is the place of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>action. In this regard a singular chance procured me a knowledge of the following.

</p>
<p>A short league [<i>lieue</i>] from Manila is a parish called Las Pe&ntilde;as (<i>les Roches</i>) [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;the rocks&#8221;]. It is under the charge of a secular priest, and has a very small church, built of bamboo and thatched with
straw. It is a charming place, and pleasure-parties often go there to dine, or walk there after dinner. I went there quite
frequently with Father Melo. One Sunday, Don Andr&eacute;s Roxo and Do&ntilde;a Ana Roxo, his wife, asked me to go there to dine with them.
Don Andr&eacute;s Roxo had married one of the daughters of the marquis of Villa-Mediana, a distinguished family of Spain. The marquis,
who has died since my return to France, was then commandant of the troops in Manila, and was to come to join us in the afternoon.
As I was walking with Monsieur and Madame Roxo in the country quite near the village, about four or five in the afternoon,
we beheld a great concourse of people gathered about the entrance of that same village. We went in that direction, to ascertain
what could be happening. It was a woman who had not attended mass that day, whom they were taking to the church to lash. She
was led along by the executioner. He had a heavy cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails on his shoulder, which hung down to the middle of his back.
The father, more black than white, went behind, and a crowd of Indians followed, especially of Indian women. Doubtless they
were those of the village, who were obliged to witness the ceremony, in order to teach them not to stay away from mass. Madame
Roxo, seeing this sight, was touched with compassion. She left us, forced her way through the crowd, and easily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>succeeded in reaching the father. She asked clemency for that woman, which was obtained.

</p>
<p>At this juncture the marquis of Villa-Mediana arrived. From as far as we could see him we went to meet him. When he asked
us whence we came, Madame Roxo told him what had just happened. But the marquis, far from approving the generosity of his
daughter, put on a severe countenance, and scolded her for it roundly in my presence. He told her in express terms <i>that she had performed a very wrong action, which would be the cause of a greater evil; that that woman would not fail to
commit that sin again, and perhaps several times, and the blame and sin for it would rebound on her who had asked for the
pardon</i>.

for fifty residents, besides the necessary offices; but part of the main building was afterward overthrown by earthquakes.
In Murillo Velarde&#8217;s time, the college had become &#8220;an aggregation of buildings, added to the original edifice from time to
time, forming a mass as bulky as architecturally irregular.... The library has no equal in the islands, in either the number
or the select <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2864" href="#xd0e2864">186n</a>]</span>quality of the books, which include all branches of learning. In several of the apartments also are very respectable libraries....
In the printing-office are several presses, and various styles of type of different sizes; and there works are produced as
accurate, well engraved, and neat as in Espa&ntilde;a&#8212;and sometimes with errors that are less stupid and more endurable. The gallery
(in which there is a truck [<i>trucos</i>, a game resembling billiards] table for the holidays) is a beautiful apartment, long, wide, and spacious; and so elevated
that it overlooks on one side the city, and on the other the great bay of Manila. From it may be seen all the galleons, pataches,
galliots, champans, and every other kind of vessels, which leave or enter the port, from America, China, Coromandel, Batavia,
and other Oriental kingdoms, and from the provinces of these islands. It is adorned (as also are the corridors) with paintings,
maps, landscapes, and other things curious and pleasant to the sight.... There is a school, for teaching reading, writing,
and arithmetic to the boys from without.... In the orchard is a house, with its offices, for the Indian house-servants, and
a church; they have their chapel, very fully equipped, in which they practice various devotions and receive the sacraments....
In charge of this, a sort of seminary, is a student brother; and in it the Indians learn the doctrine, virtue, good habits,
the holy fear of God, civilized ways, polite manners, letters, and other accomplishments, according to their ability. The
principal patio of the college is a right-angled quadrilateral; in it there is a garden bordered with rose-trees, which bear
roses all the year round, with other flowers, and medicinal herbs. There are other gardens and orchards, and seven deep wells
of running water (and some of it is very good) for drinking purposes. In the library is a round table made in one piece, almost
forty common palmos in circumference&#8212;an adornment worthy of the king&#8217;s own library.&#8221;

this doubtless refers to the marble-quarries of Montalb&aacute;n and Binangonan, in Rizal (formerly Manila) province. This stone
was of so excellent quality and texture that it remained, after more than a hundred years, uninjured by rain, sun, or air;
and the walls were so solidly built, and the wooden timbers within so durable, that in all that time it had not been necessary
to make any repairs in the framework, nor had any injury been done to the building by earthquakes or storms. The main altar
was made of a single stone. The building cost 150,000 pesos; it was not consecrated until 1727. Murillo Velarde adds: &#8220;I have

their supply of water [for the voyage] in leathern bottles or in jars which they suspended in the rigging; the water often
gave out, and they were compelled to have recourse to that supplied by the rain. The Marqu&eacute;s de Ovando had water-casks made,
and ordered that enough of these be placed aboard to supply water for the entire voyage; he framed muster-rolls, and placed
all the men on allowance. In short, the Acapulco navigation was placed on the same footing as that of Europe.&#8221;

a hermit life, wear a habit with long pointed cowl (<i>capuche</i>, whence their name), and preach the gospel in all lands. At first they were subject to the general of the conventual Franciscans,
not obtaining exemption from this obedience until 1617. Early in the eighteenth century the Capuchins numbered 25,000 friars,
with 1,600 convents, besides their missions in Brazil and Africa; but the French Revolution and other political disturbances
caused the suppression of many of their houses. At present, they are most numerous in Austria and Switzerland.

<p>[The following is taken from volume ii of Sinibaldo de Mas&#8217;s <i lang="es">Informe sobre el estado de las islas Filipinas en 1842</i> (Madrid, January, 1843).]



</p>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e3208">
<h3 class="normal">The ecclesiastical estate</h3>
<p>Shortly after Legaspi had discovered the islands, came successively religious of St. Augustine, St. Dominic, and St. Francis,
who spread through the interior and founded convents in Manila. They were the ones who accomplished most in the spiritual
and temporal conquest, as is attested uniformly by writers, native and foreign, even the least devout. Some years later, bishoprics
were erected; and from that moment began a struggle between the bishops and the monastic orders as to whether or no the friar
curas should be subject to the diocesan visit. Innumerable are the treatises, opinions, superior decrees, and scandalous disputes,
which took place on this account, as we have already seen in the chapter called &#8220;History.&#8221; The arguments of the religious
were founded on the fear of falling into relaxation of their regular observance, as they believed that they could not be good
ministers without being good religious. The religious of the Order of St. Dominic, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>discussing this point in the year 1710, resolved that, if the lords ordinary<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3215src" href="#xd0e3215">1</a> attempted to subject them to the diocesan visit, they would first abandon all their missions; <i>for the province regards it as certain and evident that the ruin of the ministering religious must follow the said visit;
and of this opinion have been, for many years past, grave religious and zealous and superior prelates whom the province has
had</i>. In the year 1757, Governor Don Pedro Manuel Arandia claimed, with the greatest firmness, that the regulars should submit
to the laws of the royal patronage in respect to the appointment of religious for the curacies, and that they should receive
the canonical installation. He first directed himself to the provincial of the calced Augustinians, even going so far as to
warn him that, if he did not obey his behests and commands in this matter, the governor would proceed to his exile and the
occupation of his temporalities. To that the provincial replied that he could not under any circumstances accede to his demands,
adding that &#8220;he knew by proof in his establishment the ruin of their regular institute, with notable harm to souls;&#8221; and that
&#8220;he was at the same time assured that the piety of the king (whom may God preserve) would not take it ill at seeing the aforesaid
province [of Augustinians] reduced to their profession and subject to the same laws of the royal patronage. Those laws, although
so just, do not bind the regulars to continue in their missions, which they obtain precariously, in case that all the royal
patronage is impracticable to them with their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>institute.&#8221; In the year 1767, and during the government of Don Simon de Anda, there came an order from Madrid, together with
a bull from Pope Benedict XIV, requiring the curas to submit to the metropolitan. The religious of St. Augustine still resisted,
which caused Anda to have all the curas in Pampanga arrested, and to send the provincial and definitors to Espa&ntilde;a. In the
year 1775 arrived a decisive order from the court, requiring all the regulars to submit to the visit and the royal patronage,
and the restoration of the curacies of Pampanga to the Augustinians. They submitted, and from that time the regular curas
have been subject to their provincial in matters <i>de vita et moribus</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, of conduct and morals], of the bishop in all that pertains to spiritual administration, and to the captain-general as the
viceregal patron. According to a royal decree of August 1, 1795, it is impossible to remove a regular cura against his will
without formulating a cause against him and trying him according to law, unless he is appointed to fill some office in the
order; and even in this case it is necessary that the consent of the ordinary and the royal vice-patron precede, in accordance
with the terms of another royal decree of September 29, 1807. Perhaps this subjection of the curas to the bishops and vice-patrons
will have resulted in great advantages; but there is no doubt that the relaxation of morals which the regular superiors foresaw
has been verified. There are many, there are numberless faults which a director recognizes and knows positively, but which
cannot be proved in a judgment, especially when one is conducting a cura of souls. Further, in a cause, it is necessary to
take depositions from the parishioners, and to make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>public matters which it would be highly important to keep secret; for scandal does more harm than the evil which one is trying
to remedy, especially in a colony where the good man and the prestige of the religious is so important. And, above all, it
ought to be remembered that since the will of three must unite to punish one cura, it will be very easy for the cura to find
a means of securing favor from some of them. Those evils would probably be remedied by rigorously obeying the commands of
Benedict XIV in his constitution beginning <i>Firmandis</i>, given November 6, 1744, in which it is ruled that the regular curas may be removed from their curacies according to the
will of one or the other superior, without its being necessary for either to declare to the other the causes of the removal.

</p>
<p>As a result of these continuous and obstinate quarrels between the regular curas and the bishops and civil authorities, and
as if to cut the Gordian knot, the government ordered, in 1753, that all the curacies be handed over to secular priests of
the country. The execution of this decree presented so many difficulties, and raised so many remonstrances that it was decided
in 1757 that, until it should be ordered otherwise, none of the curacies administered by regulars should be granted to a secular
priest under any circumstances, until it was really vacant, and that then the viceroy and the diocesan should agree together
whether or no it were advisable to make it secular; and the opinion of both should be carried into effect, and that in equal
accord they should execute the decree of 1753. By this decision, the governor-general had the power to deprive the friars
of their curacies at will, since the bishops have almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>always desired or solicited that. C&aacute;rlos III, wearied at the obstinacy of the Augustinian religious in not submitting to the
diocesan visit, ordered by decrees of August 5 and November 9, 1774, that all the missions should be secularized as they fell
vacant. The governor, then Don Simon de Anda, in spite of being at open war with the friars&#8212;because they had intrigued in
Madrid against him when the government was conferred on him&#8212;and of his being, perhaps, the governor-general most hated by
them, inveighed so strongly against this order, asserting that it was not advisable to the service of God and the State, that
the same C&aacute;rlos III resolved that the decree of 1774 should not have effect, and that the curacies and missions which the
religious had filled before the decree, should be returned to them. Nevertheless the government of Madrid was so annoyed and
wearied at the continual strife which the friars maintained with the bishops and authorities, that it desired to cut the dispute
short, at any risk; and in this same decree it was recommended that a body of Filipino secular priests be formed, so that
the curacies could be surrendered to these as they became vacant&#8212;thus carrying into effect the decree of 1757, when they should
be ready for it. This same order was confirmed by another decree of December 11, 1776, and another of September 7, 1778&#8212;although
in this last, in consideration of a representation of Don Pedro Sarrio, which will be seen later, it was provided that there
should be no innovation in what was contained in the decree of &#8217;76, without the express order of the Council and of the king.
In 1822, in consequence of a decree of the C&oacute;rtes, the curacies which fell vacant were presented at a meeting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>of opponents. In regard to the first, which was that of the village of Malate, the superior of the calced Augustinians, Fray
Hilarion Diez, made a representation; but the archbishop, Don Fray Juan Zulaybar, was interested in complying with the decrees
of the Madrid government. In 1826, order was given to return that curacy to the religious, and all [others] that they had,
and what was declared to them by the decree of 1776; and that the secularization of any curacy should not be proceeded with
except by express order of the king.

</p>
<p>I am going to insert what Don Tom&aacute;s de Comyn said about the religious of Filipinas in a book which has not had the appreciation
that it merits, and which is already rare.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The valor and constancy with which Legaspi and his worthy companions conquered these natives would have been of little use,
had not the apostolic zeal of the missionaries aided in consolidating the undertaking. The latter were the true conquerors&#8212;who,
without other weapons than their virtues, attracted the good-will of the natives, made them love the Spanish name, and gave
the king, as by a miracle, two millions more of submissive and Christian vassals. They were the legislators of the barbarous
hordes who inhabited the islands of this immense archipelago, thus realizing with their persuasive mildness the allegorical
prodigies of Amphion and Orpheus.

</p>
<p>&#8220;As the means, then, which the missionaries employed to reduce and civilize the Indians, were their preaching and other spiritual
instruments, and as, although they were scattered and working separately, they were at the same time subject to the authority
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>their superiors&#8212;who as chiefs, directed the great work of the conversion&#8212;the government primitively established in these provinces
must necessarily have shared much of the nature of the theocratic; and there is no doubt that it so continued until, the number
of the new colonists, as well the effective force of the royal authority, increasing with the lapse of time, it was possible
to make the governing system uniform with that which rules in the other ordinary establishments of Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Further, this same is deduced from the fragments which even yet remain of that first constitution in the islands of Batanes
and the missions of Cagayan, which are administered spiritually and temporally by the Dominican fathers; and from what can
be noted at every step in the other provinces, by whoever gives the matter but a little attention. For although the civil
magistracies are regulated now, and their respective attributes determined with all precision, it has been as yet impossible
to lay aside, however much they have tried to show the contrary, the personal authority which the parish priests hold among
their parishioners; on the contrary, the government has indeed seen itself constantly under the necessity of making use of
this same authority, as the most powerful instrument to acquire respect and due subordination. Consequently, although the
parish priests are not today authorized to intervene by law in the civil administration, they become in fact the real rulers.

</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is the case that, since the parish priest is the consoler of the afflicted, the pacifier of families, the promoter
of useful ideas, the preacher and example of all good; as generosity is conspicuous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>in him, and the Indians see him alone among them, without relatives, without trade, and always engaged in their greater good&#8212;they
are accustomed to live contentedly under his paternal direction, and to give him their whole confidence. Master in this way
of their wills, nothing is done without the counsel&#8212;or, to speak more correctly, without the consent&#8212;of the cura. The gobernadorcillo,
on receiving an order from the alcalde, goes first to get the permission of the father; and it is the latter who, in strict
terms, tacitly sees to its fulfilment, or prevents its course. The father concludes or directs the suits of the village; makes
the writs; goes up to the capital to plead for his Indians; opposes their petitions, and at times their threats, to the violences
committed by the alcaldes-mayor; and manages everything by the standard of his own desire. In a word, it is impossible for
there to be any human institution, at once so simple and so firmly grounded, and from which so many advantages can be derived
for the State, as that (which is admired with reason) which is firmly established in the ministries of these islands. And
by the same fatality it is very strange that since the true art of governing a colony like Filipinas, which is different from
all others, consists in the wise use of so powerful an instrument as secrecy, the superior government has been laboring under
an hallucination for some years past, to the point of pledging itself to the destruction of a work that it is so advisable
to maintain.

</p>
<p>&#8220;In this as in other things, one may very plainly see how absurd or how difficult it is to organize a system of government
which is equally well suited to the genius of all peoples, regardless of what discordance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>may exist in their physical and moral make-up. Hence, when one tries to assimilate <i>in toto</i> the administrative r&eacute;gime of these provinces to that of the Americas, he meets obstacles at every step which evidently originate
from this erroneous principle. The regime, however much one may try to assert it, must either make itself obeyed by fear and
force, or respected by means of love and confidence. And in order to convince one&#8217;s self that the first is impracticable,
it is quite sufficient to take into consideration the following circumstances and reflections.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of the whites in proportion to that of the natives is so small, that it can scarcely be set at the ratio of 15:25,000.
These provinces, infinitely more populous than those of Am&eacute;rica, are given into the care of their alcaldes-mayor, who take
there no other troops than the title of military captains and the royal decree. Besides the religious, no other whites than
their alcalde-mayor generally live in the whole province. He has the care of the royal possessions; he attends to the punishment
of evildoers; he pacifies riots; he raises men for the regiments who garrison Manila and Cavite; he orders and leads his subjects
in case of an invasion from the outside; in short, he alone must do everything, on the word of alcalde-mayor and in the name
of the king. In view, then, of the effective power that the fulfilment of so great a variety of obligations exacts spontaneously,
and the fact that no one assists him with what is in his charge, who could deny that it would be to risk the security of these
dominions too greatly to try to rule them by means so insufficient? If the villages are in disorder or revolt, to whom will
the alcalde turn his face for aid in checking and punishing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>them? What other recourse is there for him in such a conflict than to flee or to die in the attempt? And if it is considered
indispensable among cultured nations that authority always present itself accompanied by force, how can one expect that bare
and unprotected law be respected among Indians?

</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that it is necessary to appeal to force of another kind, and to employ means, which although indirect, are without
dispute the most adequate under the peculiar circumstances of these lands; means which, by influencing the imagination, excite
veneration, subjugate the rude intellect of the inhabitants, and lead them to endure our dominion without repugnance. And
well can one understand, too, how ready these means are found, and how we are envied for them and have always been envied
by all the other European nations who have aspired to extend and consolidate their conquests in both Indias.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Let one listen to La Perouse, if he would know and wonder at the arms with which our missionaries captured the natives of
the Californias. Let him read dispassionately the marvelous deeds of the Jesuits in other parts of Am&eacute;rica. And above all,
let him go to the Filipinas Islands, where he will be surprised to see those remote fields strewn with spacious temples and
convents wherein divine worship is celebrated with splendor and pomp; regularity in the streets; ease and even luxury in dress
and house; primary schools in all the villages, and the inhabitants very skilful in the art of writing; paved highways disclosed
to view; bridges constructed in good architectural style; and the greater portion of the country, finally, in strict observance
of the provisions of good government and civilization<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>&#8212;all the work of the union of the zeal, apostolic labors, and fiery patriotism of the ministering fathers. Let him traverse
the provinces, where he will see villages of five, ten, and twenty thousand Indians, ruled in peace by one weak old man who,
with his doors open at all hours, sleeps secure in his dwelling, without other magic or other guard than the love and respect
with which he has been able to inspire his parishioners. Can it be possible, on contemplating this, that by the efforts of
foolish zealots, and by the vain endeavor that only those persons assigned by the general laws in ordinary cases shall intervene
in the government of the natives, there should not only be a waste of the fruit obtained in so long a time and by so great
constancy; but also that, scorning and repelling for the future a co&ouml;peration as efficacious as economical, the attempt should
be made purposely to destroy the royal regulator, the principal wheel of this machine. Such is, notwithstanding, the deplorable
upheaval of ideas that has conduced in these latter times to the adoption of regulations diametrically opposed to the public
interest, under pretext of restraining the excessive authority of the parish priests.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The superior government does not content itself with having despoiled the ministers of the power of themselves prescribing
certain corrective punishments&#8212;which although of slight importance, contributed infinitely, when applied with discretion,
to strengthen their predominance, and consequently that of the sovereign. But, in order more effectively to exclude them from
and deprive them of all intervention in civil administration, the attempt has been made directly to destroy their influence,
by arousing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>the distrust of the Indian, and by separating, when possible, the latter from their side. In proof of this, and so that my
statement may not be taken as an exaggeration, it is sufficient to cite substantially two notable measures which, by their
tendency, were obviously intended to weaken the influence and good reputation of the spiritual administrators.

</p>
<p>&#8220;By one measure it is decreed that, for the purpose of preventing the abuses and notorious maladministration of the fund of
the saints (especially attached to the cost of the festivals and the worship of each parish, formed from the principal and
medium parishes&#8212;which are contributed by each individual tributario for that purpose, and are collected and administered privately
by the cura), it should thereafter be kept in a box with three keys, one of which was to be in the possession of the alcalde-mayor,
another in that of the gobernadorcillo of the respective village, and the other in that of the parish priest. By the other
measure, it is declared, as a general point, that the Indian who is or has recently been employed in the domestic service
of the parish priest is disqualified for being chosen to any office of justice.

</p>
<p>&#8220;It is surely superfluous to make comments upon measures of such a nature, and which so clearly speak for themselves. The
only thing that ought to be said is, that means could not more intemperately have been chosen, that are more harmful to the
state, to the propagation of religion, and even to the natives themselves. It is, indeed, very strange that so much effort
should have been exercised in impeaching the purity of the parish priests, by degrading in passing their respectable character,
just at the moment when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>circumstances would make it appear natural that because on account of the mortality and scarcity of religious, the ardor and
authority of even the few who remain ought to be encouraged by new stimulation. [This comes, too,] at a time when because
the sending of missionaries to China has been suspended, and the spiritual conquest of the Igorrotes and other infidels who
inhabit the interior of the islands has been almost abandoned the said Spanish laborers can neither give any help to the ordinary
administration, nor prevent the transference of whole provinces to the hands of secular Indians and Sangley mestizos (as is
happening)&#8212;who by their crass ignorance, disgraceful morals, and utter lack of decency, incur universally the contempt of
their parishioners, making them, because of the tyrannies of these, sigh for the gentle yoke of their former shepherds.

</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is desired, then, to keep this colony subject, and to elevate it to the lofty grade of prosperity, of which it is susceptible,
in my opinion the first thing that ought to be attempted is the efficient organization of its spiritual administration. I
say again, that we cannot be blind to the fact that, if the local government is powerless, because of the lack of military
force and the scarcity of Europeans, to make itself duly obeyed through its own efforts, it is necessary to call to its aid
the powerful influence of religion, and to bring new re&euml;nforcements of missionaries from the peninsula. For the latter differ
essentially by their nature from the rest of public servants; it is well known that they neither claim nor expect any remuneration
for their labor, aspiring only to obtain in the community the degree of respect to which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>rightfully believe themselves entitled. Let their jurisdictions, then, be preserved, let them be treated with decorum, and
let the direction of the Indian be entrusted to them; and instantly, they will be seen, in turn, reconciled, and the supporters
of the legitimate authority.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more unjust, nor of which the ministering fathers complain with more reason, than the little discernment with
which people have been accustomed to judge and condemn them, representing as common to all the body the vices of a few of
the members. Consequently, there is not one who does not read without shame and indignation the insidious motives and the
defamatory expressions lavished against them in the ordinances of good government drawn up in Filipinas in 1768<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3292src" href="#xd0e3292">2</a>&#8212;which, although ordered to be modified by his Majesty, are now in force for lack of others, and are found, printed, in the
hands of all. For even granting that in any case there can actually have existed a cause for complaint, what will it matter
at the end that this or that father may have abused the confidence reposed in him, so long as the spirit that animates the
whole body of the religious is in accord with the sanctity of their estate, and in accordance with the aims of the government?
Why must one forever pursue an ideal perfection, which cannot be obtained, and which is unnecessary in human society?&#8221;

</p>
<p>Even though this be matter which pertains to a chapter on internal policy rather than to religion, I can do no less than say,
succinctly and in passing, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>in my opinion the ideas of Se&ntilde;or Comyn are very true; and that nothing could better qualify as men weak in affairs of state
the governors or counselors who dictated the present ordinances and the above-mentioned measures and phrases printed in them
against the religious. Even supposing those sentences to be very just, wise, and merited, what need would there be, what gain
would result from printing them and placing them in the hands of the Filipinos?

</p>
<p>Those who have no liking for the friars, censure them as egoists and buffoons; as living in concubinage; as gamblers and usurers;
as arrogant, and ambitious for power.

</p>
<p>In respect to refinement, it is known that the majority [of the friars] are of obscure birth. They pass from the bosom of
the family to their novitiate; thence in a boat to the convent at Manila, and then to a village where there are no other Spaniards
than themselves. Is it strange, then, that they are not more in the current of social forms? On that account one ought to
overlook the fact that they do not know more, as is done with an honored artist or farmer. But other is the motive for this
accusation of guilt. It is said that on the arrival of a Spaniard at a village the friars do not offer him lodging, and they
often will not drink his health in a glass of water&#8212;or, at least, do not go to receive him; while everything is open for a
Filipino. This is sometimes a fact, and has happened to me more than once; but everything needs explanation, and one must
not pass judgment without hearing both sides. One must remember that there are at present many vicious and abandoned swindlers
in the islands, especially of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>class of creoles; and that such men very often form the plan to go to travel through the provinces at the cost of the curas,
either to amuse themselves or to seek their fortunes. But, for amusement, the silver spoons and other trifles of one [of the
curas] have been carried away. There are various others; especially among the recently-arrived military men, who, brought
up among disturbances, and accustomed to insult the religious with impunity, have no scruples about telling them what they
call &#8220;the truths of the coxswain.&#8221; &#8220;Who could eat free soup<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3305src" href="#xd0e3305">3</a> as you do, father, without working?&#8221; &#8220;What matters to you the good or poor harvest, so long as you have fools to impose upon?&#8221;
&#8220;How is the stewardess?&#8221; &#8220;How many children have you?&#8221;&#8212;and innumerable others of the same kind, and even much worse. Anyone
can recognize that it is very natural for these things to happen, and I myself have been a witness of them. There are more
things&#8212;namely, that many of those persons who have been in the convents take delight immediately in publishing the weaknesses
of the cura, abusing the confidence that the latter reposed in him, and (what is worse) exaggerating, and even mentioning
things that never occurred. If the friar, carried away by the good humor born of the company of a compatriot, drank a little
and became jolly, then he relates that the friar was drunk. If he saw a woman with a child in her arms who had come to speak
to the friar on any of the innumerable matters that arise in the village, then he says that he knew the sweetheart and a child
of the friar. If <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>some curas of neighboring villages assembled, and engaged in playing <i>brisca</i>, or &#8220;thirty-one,&#8221;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3316src" href="#xd0e3316">4</a> in order to pass the time, then it is said that they engaged in gambling. On that account the curas are so cautious of giving
the freedom of their houses and their friendship to transient Spaniards, that they will now scarcely receive anyone who does
not bring a letter of recommendation; and, considering this sensibly, it does not seem that they are to be censured for this
caution toward people whom they do not know, in consideration of the fact that in Manila there is no police office, and a
passport is easily given to whomever asks for it. In spite of all this, some curas&#8212;as for instance, Father Lorieri of Paniqui&#8212;without
having any notice of me, received me with gratifying and ready hospitality. For the rest, the convents are usually the lodging-houses
and inns of the village.

</p>
<p>The friars in Filipinas are quite different from those in Espa&ntilde;a. They are very glad to see a Spaniard arrive, when they know
that he is not a malicious person. They have traveled, and they have escaped from the conversations and meetings of the convent;
they are more tolerant, because they have rubbed against many Spaniards of liberal ideas; they have found that the lion is
not so fierce as it is painted, and that there are respectable people in all parties, and men with good hearts&#8212;especially
in that which takes for its goal the good of the country. How often would we abhor people less if we approached them and became
acquainted with them! We must confess also that the hate cherished by the religious in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>Espa&ntilde;a toward the liberals proceeds in great measure from the personal insults which they have endured; while in Filipinas
these are very few and are neutralized by the tokens of veneration and respect which others pay them, because of circumstances
which are entirely distinct from those of Espa&ntilde;a. A man without prejudice and with a suitable standard of judgment, who lives
in the metropolis [<i>i.e.</i>, Madrid], sees in a friar the enemy of reforms, of progress, and of public prosperity; but, when he is in Filipinas, he sees
in this same friar the benefactor of the public, and the preserver of tranquillity and of the colony. Consequently he considers
and treats the friar differently than in Espa&ntilde;a, and is repaid in the like coin. From this it happens that many who come from
Espa&ntilde;a with very exaggerated and preconceived ideas against the religious&#8212;even to the point of never having had relations
or speech with a friar&#8212;and here have to come in contact with them, are surprised to find some (and even very many) of them
very sociable, serviceable, tolerant, and worthy of all appreciation; and this has happened to me myself, both in Filipinas
and in Palestina.

</p>
<p>In regard to their being gamblers, I can say that when several curas of the neighboring villages assemble on the feast-day
of a village, they sometimes play to pass the hot hours of the day; but I have never seen in the houses of Spanish religious
what can be called play for gaining and losing money, and, in the convents of Manila, cards are not even played for amusement.
I know this positively.

</p>
<p>As for some of them leading licentious lives with women, I will not say that it is false, although I could not say that I
know of such. I believe, indeed, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>there is much exaggeration in this as in other things, and that not one quarter of it is to be believed. An official, not
at all partial to the friars, and who lived several years in Pangasinan, told me that he never could discover that any of
the Dominicans who minister there had a sweetheart; and that, if perchance any of them had one, he concealed it very carefully,
since he himself had never known any trace of it. Concerning that point, I will say, although it appears evil to many, that
that offense is the most excusable, especially in young and healthy men, placed in the torrid zone. Nature must struggle continually
with duty. The garb of the Filipina women is very seductive; and it is known that the girls, far from being untractable to
the cura, consider themselves lucky to attract his attention, and their mother, father, and relatives share that sentiment
with them. What virtue and stoicism does not the friar need to possess! Let those who criticise them on this point imagine
themselves to be living in a village without relatives or friends, or any other fellow-countrymen, at least with whom they
can converse; and then let them be candid. Don I&ntilde;igo Azaola told me that, meditating on the reason why so many Spanish religious
went mad, he thought that it had its origin in the continual struggle between nature and devotion.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3332src" href="#xd0e3332">5</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>In regard to usurers, there may be some among them who are addicted to trade, since the business carried on in the provinces
consists chiefly in advancing money at seed-time, in order to receive the fruits at harvest time at a much lower price than
is current in the market. Surely the cura who embarks in these speculations not only fails in his most sacred duty,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3343src" href="#xd0e3343">6</a> but even gnaws at and gives a deathblow to the principal base upon which rests the prestige and veneration enjoyed by the
religious of Filipinas. Nothing infuses these weak and greedy islanders with so much love, surprise, and respect as does contempt
for gold and for earthly goods. The generous minister, he who gives, will be considered as good, most good, and will obtain
whatever he wants from his parishioners. The greedy and avaricious, he who does what common and vile men do, will, notwithstanding
the habit in which he is clad, notwithstanding the sermons he preaches, be considered as mean, if he does not end by being
despised and abhorred. Nevertheless, I can affirm that the religious who trade are very few, and among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>Dominicans, not any. And this, and their anxiety for saving their stipends and for making money, proceeds in great measure
from the information which they receive concerning the wretched condition of the religious in Espa&ntilde;a, and their fear of falling
into the same condition.

</p>
<p>In respect to their pride and ambition to govern, all men have that, for this is our most powerful instinct; and the priests
of all times and countries have had it. The royal decrees and the articles of which we have spoken demonstrate quite clearly
that those of Filipinas have not escaped from falling into this sin. Up to a certain point, one can affirm that the civil
government itself&#8212;or, to speak more accurately, circumstances&#8212;have placed them in a position where they must take part in
the temporal administration. In a whole province, there is no other Spaniard in authority except the alcalde-mayor, and he
never knows a word of the idiom of the country (see my remarks on] the administration of justice). Hence it necessarily arises
that the alcalde-mayor does not know more than the natives allow him to know; and that the gobernadorcillos of the villages
are masters, inasmuch as in everything they do whatever they think proper. In order to obviate these inconveniences, scarcely
is any document asked in which the government does not require the supervision of the cura; and in this way it obliges him
to be acquainted with matters quite at variance with his ministry. The cura possesses the language, resides in the village,
has the means of the confessional,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3350src" href="#xd0e3350">7</a> and when he wishes there are but few matters, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>even the most trivial, that can be hidden from him. On the contrary the alcalde, not having any of these advantages, can have
knowledge of but few things, if the parish priest does not communicate them. I shall quote here what father Fray Manuel del
Rio says on this point. &#8220;Although the temporal government of the village that he administers does not belong to the obligation
of the minister of souls, but it may, on the contrary, be prejudicial to his obligation and ministry for him to meddle too
much in this; yet on certain occasions it is necessary for the minister to put his shoulder to the wheel so that the village
may be well governed&#8212;now by directing the gobernadorcillos in its employ, now by encouraging them and giving them zeal and
energy and courage in certain decisions which they, through their cowardice, do not dare to make unless an order or command
proceed from the minister; now also by restraining the audacity of the greater against the less, in order to prevent the annoyances
that the chiefs practice upon their <i>cailianes</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e3362src" href="#xd0e3362">8</a>&#8212;thereby protecting the cause of the wretched, which is one of the duties <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>that the council of Trent (in the place cited at the beginning of this work), commits to those who are ministers of souls.

</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two kinds or modes of annoyances which the Indians who are more influential practice on those of lower rank. Some
are peculiar to the cabezas de barangay, with their cailianes; others are common to every kind of rich Indian toward the poor.
I shall first treat of those of the first class, and next, of those of the second.

</p>
<p>&#8220;First, the cabezas are accustomed to impose on their cailianes certain taxes of silver, rice, and other products, under pretexts
that they there feign, of service to the church or to the village. Perhaps, they cast the blame on the alcalde, who is most
often unaware of such taxes and is not told of them. The remedy is that, when the minister learns of it, he causes the cabezas
to be punished, and the silver to be returned to the cailianes.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, when the father or some passenger pays the Indian rowers or carriers, or tanores, through the medium of the cabeza
or of the government, the silver generally does not reach the hands of the Indians; but the cabezas keep it, under pretexts
which they advance that the Indians owe a certain polo or tribute, long overdue, or similar things. The same thing happens
with the money which the father or passengers give them with which to buy provisions, and, with the <i>opas</i> of those who perform personal duty for others. The remedy for all this is for the minister to solicit him to pay the money
to all [the Indians] into their own hands; and especially should he do that in what he buys [from them] or when he makes the
Indians perform any work.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Third, that in the polos the cabezas exempt whomever they wish, without other justification than that they choose to do so;
and because those persons contribute silver, tobacco, or rice to the cabeza, thereby exempting themselves from personal service
throughout the year. In that way the yoke of the polos and personal service is loaded on those of less influence. Consequently
the personal service comes upon the Indians more frequently; <i>e.g.</i>, although the village can have two months of rest (if there is order and harmony), it is usual for lack of that to have a
return [of the personal service] every month, or every six weeks, if the minister does not attend to it, or intervene in the
distribution of the personal service, by investigating and showing up these frauds of the cabezas.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth, in the tree-cuttings that arise for the king or for the village, all those who are cited do not go, many redeeming
themselves with money which they give to their cabeza or to the petty officer [who exacts the work], thus burdening with all
the work those who go&#8212;from which it follows that the felling of the timber is extended in time, and lasts longer than is necessary;
and also that the petty officers or the cabezas make the Indians work for their own private interests. All of the above cannot
be remedied unless the minister undertake to station secret spies, to advise him of the number of those who go, and also of
those who work there more than is necessary for the king or for the village&#8212;so that those who shall be involved in such frauds
may be punished, and so that they may be made to pay what they have usurped.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifth, the gobernadorcillos of the villages appoint <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>the officials whom they wish to help in their government. Many of them buy off their personal attention to it with money,
which they give to the gobernadorcillo, and only help on Sundays with their authority, remaining the rest of the time in their
houses. Consequently, the personal service of the village falls on very few, because of these and other like exemptions by
the gobernadorcillos and cabezas for money, by which they themselves alone profit. For this reason, one must assign a definite
number of bilangos or constables, outside of which number the gobernadorcillo cannot assign others. It appears sufficient
that in villages of five hundred tributes twelve bilangos be appointed, so that each week four may aid, together with their
constable-in-chief and lieutenant. In smaller villages nine are sufficient, so that three may aid every week. In very large
villages there may be fifteen or eighteen, so that five or six may assist every week. Thus in all the villages the bilangos
would rest two weeks, which is sufficient relaxation, since their personal duty is not very heavy.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixth, in the collection of tributes, the cabezas perform many acts of injustice; for some are accustomed to collect the
entire tribute of rice, and then to collect separately what they call &#8216;the stipend of the father,&#8217; as if that were not included
in the tribute. Some collect from each person six gantas more than they ought to give; for in many villages they receive fifty-eight
cates as a kind of half tribute, and in others they receive from one house sixty cates from one and fifty-five from another,
and it amounts to the same. There is generally an inequality in the balances used for weighing there in the field, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>only God is witness, and the cabeza or collector, who weighs according to his pleasure. Not less is the deceit existing in
the collection of oil, for double the amount asked from them by the king is usually taken, and the cabezas keep it; because
they assess it among all the cailianes, although often half the barangay would be sufficient to obtain the assessment, and
thus they could alternate between the two halves each year. All these troubles are usually encountered, and the worst is that
they are often concealed so skilfully that the minister can learn of them but seldom; and for that reason I write them here,
so that warning may be taken and the remedy procured&#8212;not only in respect to the charge on the consciences of those who occasion
them, but in the matter of restitution to the sufferers, not neglecting to check these abuses, and to solicit that they be
condignly punished by the civil authority.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventh, others make their cailianes serve the entire year in their house or field, under pretext of paying their tribute
for them. Some deliver them to mestizos or to other Indians, as if they were their slaves. In this way there are cabezas who
hold many cailianes in slavery, making them serve in their houses for many years&#8212;without allowing them sometimes to hear mass
or to go to the village, so that the father may not see them.

</p>
<p>&#8220;All public works, both great and small, ought to be consulted over with the village itself which has to construct and pay
for them. But it is to be noted that the village does not settle upon them, but the cabezas only. Rather they are a suspicious
party, in this point, for if there is any work in the village, the cabezas are wont to have the greatest advantage from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>it. Consequently, they are generally the first to encourage the government officials to undertake any work; for not only do
they not have to work at it, but they hope to get some benefit from it by the methods which they know how to use.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The reading of these instructions can give an idea of the internal government of a Filipino settlement, and the impossibility
that impartiality and efficient justice can rule, if there is no intervention by the cura. I will add that the latter regards
the village in a certain manner as his own. He enjoys seeing its prosperity and its advancement, as he thinks that this is
his work. He takes an interest in its having good roads, harvests, tools, irrigation, and everything that can enrich and beautify
it. Many curas spend all their money in public works, and on their churches. They rival one another, each striving to have
in his own village the richest altars, the best houses, musicians, schools, and finely-dressed people. It is a sight worth
seeing, a friar constituting himself overseer and director of a wooden bridge or of a causeway&#8212;administering a buffet to this
one, a shove to another; praising that one, or calling this other a lazy fellow; giving a bunch of cigars to the one who stays
an hour longer to work, or carries most bricks up to the scaffold; promising to kill a cow for the food of next day; and making
them offers, often without any intention of fulfilling them, only with the object of encouraging them, and deceiving them
like children.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3412src" href="#xd0e3412">9</a> But whoever knows the country can do no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>less than confess that this is the only means to get any advantage out of the lazy and childish Filipinos, who have no needs;
and that the cura has infinite advantages over the governor, for his buffets do not offend, his requests oblige, and his love
to the village and his disinterestedness captivate and interest these people, and make them as wax. Thus indeed can it be
said that the cura is the soul of the village. In any province where its ruler is united with the curas, where the latter
honor the alcalde and instruct him of all that happens, and he gives them the aid that is necessary to preserve their prestige&#8212;in
that province, I say, there are no thefts, no disorders, no complaints, no tears, no insurrections, nor any other thing but
a complete and durable peace,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3422src" href="#xd0e3422">10</a> and great submission and reverence to the Spaniards. At the present time that may be seen in the provinces where the governor
has the right desires and a clear understanding, and recognizes the error into which the government has fallen during the
last few years, in trying to deprive the curas of the civil administration, by forcing them to reduce themselves to spiritual
matters, and to tolerate irreligious acts. The province of Pangasinan, for example, finds itself in this case under the orders
of the worthy alcalde-mayor, Don Francisco de Lila, a volunteer of the militia of Manila and a very decided liberal: I have
traveled through this province by night, with only one servant, without arms, and quite without fear, although there was not
a soldier in the whole province. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>The horses and buffaloes were feeding in the meadows without herders; and, on my arrival at the capital, I went out with him
in his carriage. In all the streets and from all the windows, we were saluted with great show of affection, and the children
began to jump for joy, and to cry out, &#8220;Good afternoon, father.&#8221; The tears started to my eyes, and I said: &#8220;Ah, simple people,
how little do you know the blessing that you enjoy! Neither hunger, nor nakedness, nor inclemency of the weather troubles
you. With the payment of seven reals per year, you remain free of contributions. You do not have to close your houses with
bolts. You do not fear that the district troopers will come in to lay waste your fields, and trample you under foot at your
own firesides. You call &#8216;father&#8217; the one who is in command over you. Perhaps there will come a time when you will be more
civilized, and you will break out in revolution; and you will awake terrified at the tumult of the riots, and will see blood
flowing through these quiet fields, and gallows and guillotines erected in these squares, which never yet have seen an execution.&#8221;
&#8220;But is it not true also,&#8221; I reflected later, &#8220;that this present happiness may be transitory up to a certain point, and that
a changing of the captain-general or of the alcalde can cause great evils, and change the aspect of so pleasing a picture?
Yes, it is a lamentable truth; and I shall do what is in my power so that your lot may be less precarious, and so that the
government which rules you may be so organized that you may be as little as possible subject to the injustice and avarice
of men; and so that, wherever you see a Spaniard, you may salute him with love and call him father.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>But returning from our digressions to our matter in hand, I believe that if it is useful and indispensable for the parish
priest to know, directly or indirectly, the particular affairs of the village, it is evident that far from undermining his
authority, it ought to strengthen it as much as possible. From the time of the conquest, the curas have availed themselves
of the expedient of applying some lashes to the natives, when the fathers have believed it necessary in order to correct faults,
whether religious or those of another kind; and it is known that this has contributed not a little to the preservation of
devotion. It is also known that they have not been hated for this by the islanders; but, on the contrary, the friars have
constantly merited their love and have enjoyed a prestige which no one doubts. Everyone knows that if the friars have shown
themselves exaggerated and unreasonable in anything, it has been in the protection of the Filipinos&#8212;more, indeed, than they
deserved and than healthy justice demanded. Let us listen to the following words of Fray Casimiro Diaz: &#8220;The old laws in regard
to the execution of the tributes were harsh, even to the point of making slaves of the debtors, and even killing them with
lashes, or mutilating them. And although these laws were abolished from the time of Constantine as wicked, and have with the
law of Christ been moderated within judicious limits, this benefit has not been obtained by the Indians. The Indian is beaten
for his tribute. The goods of the Indian are sold for the tribute, and he is left destitute all his life. The Indian is enslaved
for the tribute; for the cabeza de barangay, under pretext that he is getting back what the Indian owes, takes his house away
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>him, and, for the five reals that the Indian owes, makes him serve one whole year. In short, the wrongs which the tribute
brings upon the poor wretch are so many, that the greatest charity which the parish priest can show him is to pay it himself.&#8221;
The above shows how this good father grieves because the Indian has to pay five reals per year&#8212;five reals, which a Filipino
can get by simply planting a cocoa or cacao tree at the door of his hut. How happy would be the Spaniards, or the French and
English, and any other Europeans, if they had no more to pay than that! But it is not credible that Father Diaz was unacquainted
with the people who so broke his heart, and that he did not know the measures resorted to in the country. A few pages farther
on the same father says: &#8220;The poverty of these Indians is not their curse, but it is their own idleness and laziness, and
they content themselves with little. They are not ruled by covetousness; and, although there is some covetousness, their fondness
for doing nothing tempers it, and they wish to live rather by providence than to dedicate themselves to work.&#8221; What, then,
would the good Father Diaz wish? that the Filipinos should not be made to contribute even the little amount that they now
contribute, and that the government of Espa&ntilde;a should send money there from the mother country in order to meet all the expenses
of state, at the cost of increasing the heavy taxes which the Spaniards already pay? And all this, for what motive? Because
the Filipinos are very &#8220;fond of doing nothing, desiring rather to live under the care of providence than to dedicate themselves
to work.&#8221; For thus are the fathers all, often carrying this enthusiasm or mania <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>for protection to a ridiculous extreme&#8212;for it is the same to touch one of their parishioners and the apple of their eye. At
times they make use of unjust and compromising expressions: Thus the tobacco monopoly is &#8220;an imposition&#8221; or &#8220;a bit of knavery.&#8221;
The impost for elections of gobernadorcillos, the signing of a passport, or any other accidental expense which is incurred
[by the Indian], is &#8220;a theft.&#8221; The services for the repairing of roads and bridges are &#8220;annoyances&#8221; or &#8220;tyrannies.&#8221; And so
on all in this tenor. Many would wish that the Filipino be left stretched out at ease all day long, and that afterward the
manna should fall, and he have no other work than to open his mouth. Whoever has known the country, especially in former years,
can do no less than say that there is not the least exaggeration in the picture which I draw; that the letters and remonstrances
of the religious are what have been influential in dictating the laws of the Indias&#8212;which breathe out in every one of their
lines, so great piety and mildness that one would believe that they treat only of innocent and tender lambs which are found
among wolves. These know, too, that this same spirit has always led the religious to support the quarrels that have arisen
against the civil and military government, which have, for the greater part, given origin to royal orders against them, and
to the indiscreet articles of the ordinances which we have cited. Notwithstanding all this, during the last years certain
new arrivals from Espa&ntilde;a, especially those of the class of auditors and governors-general, have been feverish on hearing that
the curas of the villages have whippings administered; and decrees have been fulminated against many provinces, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>order to check this. In fact, they have attained that object; but the result of this most fatal error has been the increase
of impiety in an astonishing manner, and there are a great number of villages where few go to mass, and more than the third
part refuse to take the communion&#8212;which is probably also the cause of the increase in criminality which has been noted. But
a short time ago, during the government of General Lardizabal, the religious presented a petition through the archbishop,
asking that they be allowed to administer corrective punishment at the door of the church, as had always been their custom
with those who were remiss in complying with the duties of religion. The government replied that the curas should avail themselves
in such cases of advice and admonition, but that they should under no circumstances punish anyone corporally; and to complete
matters, this ruling was circulated and communicated to the natives themselves, a measure that caused the greatest grief to
the parish priests. The good Se&ntilde;or Lardizabal, who had an excellent heart, himself told me this incident, very well satisfied
at the manner in which it had worked. We shall discuss this matter more at length in the chapter on &#8220;Internal policy.&#8221;

</p>
<p>There are regular and secular clergy in Filipinas. The latter are more numerous, and include some mestizos, Chinese, and many
full-blooded Filipinos. The bishops, in spite of being Spanish, have almost always shown themselves hostile to the friars
and patrons to the seculars. The origin of this partiality must be found in the old-time fight between the bishops and the
regular curas&#8212;who defend their rights with tenacity; while the natives are submissive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>and most humble to the prelates and flatter them. Notwithstanding the protection of the bishops, the seculars have generally
had a very bad reputation; and many private persons, of every class and in every epoch, have openly declared against them.

</p>
<p>The religious now living in Filipinas, excepting those of the Order of St. Francis, are not able to fill the curacies in their
charge&#8212;although there are curas who take under their charge an extension which they are unable, notwithstanding all their
efforts, to administer well. The cura of Surigao has twelve visitas or dependent towns. From this condition there results,
among other evils, this: that when there is any cura who is unruly or of evil conduct, there is no method of summoning him
to the convent and replacing him with another. Hence proceeds the laxity which is consequent on impunity.

</p>
<p>I have been not a little surprised to see that there is a lack of religious in Filipinas, where they enjoy the thorough protection
of the government, and great consideration in the villages; where all have at least what is necessary to live with ease,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3447src" href="#xd0e3447">11</a> since they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>able to command more from their domestic servants, and from all the singers, sacristans, and other dependents of the Church&#8212;and
this while in Espa&ntilde;a there is such an oversupply of them, and they live so uncomfortably. The curacy is generally worth to
the parish priest one peso fuerte<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3457src" href="#xd0e3457">12</a> to each tribute. The ministers of villages which contain more than one thousand five hundred or two thousand tributes usually
have one or more assistants, according to their wish, with the consent of the bishop. The parish priest generally gives the
assistant a house, his board, and ten or twelve pesos fuertes per month; and leaves to him the fees for the masses, which
are worth to him in excess of one peso fuerte every day&#8212;so that, besides his lodging and support, the assistant can count
upon thirty-five or forty pesos fuertes per month. The administrative ecclesiastical division follows:

</p>
<p>There is one archbishop in the capital, and three suffragans&#8212;to wit, the bishop of Nueva Segovia, he of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and
he of Zeb&uacute;.

</p>
<p>The archbishopric includes the provinces of Tondo, Bulacan, Pampanga, Batangas, Cav&iacute;te, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>Laguna, Bataan, Zambales, and Mindoro. It contains one hundred and sixty-seven curacies, of which ninety-five are served by
religious, and seventy-two by secular priests.

</p>
<p>The bishopric of Nueva Segovia comprises the provinces of Pangasinan, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Cagayan, and the missions
of Ituy, of Pangui, of Abra, and of Batanes. It contains ninety-two curacies, of which eighty are served by religious, and
twelve by seculars.

</p>
<p>The bishopric of Nueva C&aacute;ceres comprises the provinces of Tayabas, part of Nueva Ecija, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, and
Albay. It contains eighty-four curacies, of which twenty-seven are served by religious, and fifty-seven by seculars.

</p>
<p>The bishopric of Zeb&uacute; comprises the provinces of Zeb&uacute;, Iloilo, Capis, Antique, Negros, Caraga, Misamis, Zamboanga, Samar,
Leyte, and Marianas (three hundred leguas distant). It contains one hundred and forty-three curacies, of which eighty-six
are served by regulars and fifty-seven by seculars.

</p>
<p>At present there are four hundred and fifty Spanish religious in Filipinas, and seven hundred Filipino secular priests, or
thereabouts. More than three per cent of the Spaniards die annually; so that, in order that their present number may not diminish,
it is necessary for fifteen to go there annually.

</p>
<p>As a conclusion to this chapter, I cannot resist the desire to insert the words of a wise religious of Filipinas of former
days, Father Pedro Murillo Velarde, as it may be useful to the ministers of the present time who may read these pages.

</p>
<p>&#8220;To take the mean of the proportion in the administration of the Indians is one of the most difficult <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>matters of the prudence. The parish priest must be in the village the loving father, the hospitable tutor, the master and
diligent teacher of his parishioners; and as such he must not treat them as if he were a seignior of vassals. He must be dignified,
but without affecting majesty. He should always strive to be loved, rather than feared. He must be affable, but not vulgar.
He must not separate himself far from intercourse with his parishioners, nor be too familiar. He should visit them in charity
rather than in affection. He should listen to their complaints, but not to their malicious reports. He should settle their
controversies, but not in a partial manner. He should not be altogether credulous, nor despise everything. If one Indian accuses
another, he should ascertain, before all else, whether they have quarreled. He must not be all honey, nor all gall. He should
punish, but not flay off the skin. If the Indian knows that there is no whip near, the village will be quickly lost. A good
beating at the proper time is the best antidote for all sorts of poisons; for, in the end, fear guards the vineyard. In punishments,
let him show himself a father, not a hangman; and, in case of doubt, let him incline rather to mildness than to severity.
Let him hear quarrels and discussions with the alcaldes, but let him not allow them to fleece his sheep. Let him defend his
own jurisdiction, but not usurp that of another. Let him not become an alcalde unless the alcalde tries to become a cura.
If he is unable to settle the quarrels of the Indians satisfactorily, he shall allow them to go to the alcalde, who will quickly
render them harmonious by laughing at the matter of the quarrel. Let him handle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>books, but not cards.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3496src" href="#xd0e3496">13</a> Let him [not] direct the Indians in the government of his village, but let him leave them to those who govern them; for the
wish to command is a sort of itch in Filipinas. Consequently, let him leave to each one the care of what God has given him.
Let him check sins, but not lawful games and amusements, since thereby other and illicit amusements will be prevented. Let
him eradicate drunkenness, but not prohibit all use of wine to all; for, if the cura drinks wine, why should not the Indian
drink it in moderation? Let him not pour out the wine or break the wine-jars; for who has given him any authority for that?
Because of some of these acts of imprudence, certain foolish laymen say that the ministers who come from Europa to become
martyrs, become more than kings in their villages.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him attend to the affairs of God, and not obstruct those of Caesar. Let him be the mirror of the village, so that all
may imitate him; but not a telescope, to register foolish trifles. Let him get from the Indian what the latter is able to
give; for he who tries to get everything loses everything. If the Indians learn that their sins are unpardonable, many will
take to the hills. If the father is very harsh in the confessional, many sacrileges may be feared. In assigning penance, let
him incline to mildness rather than to rigor, if he wishes the penance to be observed. Let his diligence when he preaches
be not long, but fervid; for one onza of gold is worth more than an arroba of straw. Let <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>him explain to the Indians what is necessary for their salvation, and let him not play the discreet among them. Let him use
similes and examples in his sermons that they can understand, and not plunge into depths of abstract ideas, for that is a
jargon which they do not understand; and they especially detest Latin phrases. The statement that the Indians have no faith
is a pretext of the devil, to discourage the gospel ministers. Let him do with fervor whatever he finds to do, that the corresponding
fruit may not be lacking; and even when there should be no fruit, God will reward his zeal. Let him not raise difficulties
in taking the sacraments to the fields, but let it be with the reverence due. Let him insist on the presence of the boys at
the school, for the good that follows from that is great; but let him not urge them so much that he wearies them. Let him
receive the fees of the Church, but let him not collect with the severity of a warrant-holder. Let the Indians know that the
cura is looking after their souls, not their purses; and let him remember that he came from Europa to remove disease from
the sheep, not to take their wool. Let him give alms, but let him not scatter the patrimony of Christ uselessly. It will be
a suitable alms to provide his parishioners with medals, rosaries, catechisms, and bulls [of the crusade].<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3512src" href="#xd0e3512">14</a> Let him not permit idle spongers in the village, who are goblins of cursed consequences; and the whiter they are, the worse.
Let the cura be found more often in the houses of the sick and dying, than in weddings, games, and dances. He should let the
customs of the villages alone, when they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>involve no grave disadvantages, for innovations alter men&#8217;s dispositions; and more than anything else must he shun causing
innovation in the prayer, and in matters pertaining to the Church and the method of administration. Let him encourage congregations,
devotions, and novenas, frequent confession, daily mass, and the rosary, but let him warn the Indians that these are not for
obligation but for devotion, since perhaps they sin through ignorance, when there is no guilt. The soul of the missionary
or parish priest has a thousand dangers in the solitude of a village; but with prayer and mortification he can overcome all.
Chastity is a flower so delicate that it takes but little to make it wither: the heart of man, the opportunity for temptations,
the frequency of errors, and the ease with which men stumble, are as tinder and fire, which are kindled, whoever blows. Do
not believe that in this regard there is any caution that is too great in the Indias. In the external encounters that may
arise with alcaldes or with others, let the cura endeavor to conquer them by patience rather than by arrogance. Let him remember
that Jesus Christ says we should offer the other cheek to him who smites us; and let him reflect that in the tribunal of God,
and even that of men, more is to be gained by humility than by valor. Let him reflect that he is a secular or a religious;
and that the weapons of such are tears, prayer, and penance.&#8221;

the friars who are insane with the insane found also among the other Spaniards, in order to declare quite the contrary. Quite
different do I believe the origin of the insanity, both of the religious and of the other Spaniards. He who has had anything
to do with the Indian will have observed that his nature is quite contrary to that of the Spaniard. The latter is generally
lively, acute, and full of fire, while that of the Indian, on the contrary, is dull, somber, and cold as snow. The Spaniard
who does not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e3334" href="#xd0e3334">229n</a>]</span>arm himself with patience and forbearance, is liable to become, I do not say insane, but desperate. Another reason even may
be assigned, in what pertains to the religious. As a general thing, their insanity has as its primal cause melancholy; and
this is very common to the regular curas who are alone, and who, experiencing the ingratitude of the Indian, his fickleness
in virtue, and his indifference in matters of religion, think that their sacrifice for the natives is in vain. Consequently,
the curas need great courage in order to calm themselves and to persevere in the even tenor of their life. In my opinion these
two reasons can fully account for the origin of the cases of insanity among many.&#8221; (Note by Father Juan Ferrando, written

Indian, but the cura can never make use of it for the investigations that the government exacts. 1 believe that it will be

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href="#xd0e3447src" id="xd0e3447">11</a></span> &#8220;This proposition, founded on the common opinion of those who have seen none except the curacies of the rich and well-populated
provinces, cannot be maintained in any manner. In the environs of Manila, where the food and services cost dearer than in
the city itself, the cura in charge of a village which does not number more than one thousand tributes cannot live with decency.
For here also generally fails what you say in another place, namely, that the cura&#8217;s income can be adjusted at a peso for
each tribute. In the distant provinces&#8212;as, for instance, Cagayan and other distant parts&#8212;since food and services are very
cheap, and the cura does not have to spend anything except on the things that he requests from Manila, if the village reaches
500 tributes it will be sufficient for him, but not below the said number; and even in the first case, if he has a sufficient
number of masses to apply with alms, which rarely happens. I pray you now to consider the fact that the majority of the villages
of the archbishopric do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e3449" href="#xd0e3449">244n</a>]</span>exceed 1,000 tributes, and those of the other bishoprics 500. What would you say it you knew what passes in the villages that
even preserve the names of missions? The government gives them a small stipend, of less than 300 pesos, and a few cabans of
palay. On this they have to support themselves, as well as the church edifice and divine worship, as there are no fees on
the part of the village; for as missionaries they do not have parochial fees. Consequently, if they wish to live with some
comfort, they have to engage in stockraising; and those who do not possess a somewhat regulated conscience will have to devote
themselves to unseemly traffic.&#8221; (Note of Father Juan Ferrando, written on the margin of the manuscript of this chapter.)&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Mas</span>.

</p>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e3529">
<h3 class="normal">Archbishopric of Manila</h3>
<p>Manila is in this regard, as in all other departments, the metropolitan city of the Spanish countries in the Orient. Its see
is archiepiscopal, and has as suffragans the bishoprics of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, Nueva Segovia, and Ceb&uacute;, descriptions of which can
be found in their respective articles. The territory over which it presides, as proper to itself, includes the ten civil provinces
nearest to Manila&#8212;namely, Tondo, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva-Ecija, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, Zambales, and Mindoro&#8212;in
addition to the small island of Corregidor, which is found outside the said province, and which forms a military police commandancy.
It is not so extensive, with these provinces, as are its suffragan sees; but it is the one that unites the greatest number
of souls.

</p>
<p>The territory included in it extends about 100 leguas north and south and 29 more in breadth toward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>the west, the villages most distant from its capital being some 40 leguas to the north, and about 60 to the south. It is bounded
on the north by the diocese of Nueva Segovia, and on the south by that of Ceb&uacute;. Its western boundaries are maritime. The number
of parishes of this diocese, the secular and regular curas who have charge of them, and the number of villages that they contain,
will be seen in chart number 8.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3538src" href="#xd0e3538">1</a>

</p>
<p>For the more efficient ecclesiastical administration of the territory included in this archbishopric, the parish curas of
certain villages also extend their jurisdiction to eighteen vicariates or outside districts, namely: in the province of Tondo,
that of Mariquina; in the province of Bataan, that of Balanga; in the province of Cavite, that of Bacor; in the province of
Mindoro, those of Calayan and Santa Cruz; in the province of Batangas, those of Taal, San Pablo, and Rosario; in the province
of Laguna, those of Limban, Calauan, and Cabuyas; in the province <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>of Bulacan, those of Quingua and Marilao; in the province of Zambales, that of Iba; in the province of Pampanga, those of
San Fernando and Candaba; in the province of Nueva-Ecija, those of Puncan and Baler. The curas of the above-mentioned villages
are the outside vicars of their respective districts. They receive orders and instructions indiscriminately from the vicar-general
and from the diocesan, from each one in accordance with the attributes of his office. It must be noted that this division
into districts is subject to continual variations at the will of the bishop who wears the miter&#8212;now in relation to the number,
and again with respect to the village. When it is said that the outside vicars depend immediately on the vicars-general or
provisors, one must not, under any consideration, understand that the latter constitute an authority or jurisdiction intermediate
between the outside vicar and the archbishop; but that they are the means by which communication with the said archbishop
ought to be held. The present prelate of this metropolitan church is his Excellency the most illustrious and reverend Don
Fray Jos&eacute; Aranguren, member of his Majesty&#8217;s Council, knight of the grand cross of Isabel the Catholic, senator of the kingdom,
and deputy vicar-general of the royal land and naval armies of all our eastern possessions. He was consecrated on January
31, 1847. The cabildo of this holy and metropolitan church, the only such church in Filipinas, is composed of five dignitaries,
three canons, two racioneros, two medio-racioneros, and the suitable number of ministers, whose salaries may be seen in the
following chart.

</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical court is composed of the most excellent and illustrious archbishop, the provisor and vicar-general, the
ecclesiastical fiscal, a recording secretary, a vice-secretary, an archivist, and two notarial treasurers of the secular class.
The provisorial court is formed by the provisor, who is at the same time vicar-general and judge of the chaplains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>He is charged with the performance of judicial acts in ecclesiastical matters, and is accompanied by notaries. This unctionary
did not formerly have the investiture as licentiate of laws, and was assisted by a matriculated lawyer of the royal Audiencia.
The creation of the ecclesiastical fiscal was posterior to that of the ecclesiastical courts; and his institution is due to
the authority of the pontiffs, who have especially charged said functionaries with the defense of the integrity of marriages,
and other duties peculiar to their employments. The charge of provisor was at first exercised constantly by the Augustinian
fathers, by virtue of the <i lang="es">amnimodo</i> authority granted by the popes; later, their attributes passed to the Franciscan fathers, by agreement with them. But the
archbishop of M&eacute;jico, considering himself empowered to appoint ecclesiastical judges (who were to be the vicars and provisors
of these dominions), sent two clerics with authorization to exercise the said offices. The governor,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3787src" href="#xd0e3787">2</a> however, with his rank as royal vice-patron, protected the regulars in their privileges, and ordered Father Alfaro to exercise
the said office alone. Afterward, when the suffragan bishoprics were created, and that of Manila was erected to the dignity
of a metropolitan, with the archiepiscopal hierarchy, the appointment of provisors was regulated.

</p>
<p>The spiritual administration of any of the bishoprics that fall vacant devolves upon the metropolitan archbishop, and the
latter is the one empowered to appoint a provisor or capitular vicar. In case that the archiepiscopal metropolitan see should
become vacant also, the government devolves upon the nearest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>bishop; and if there be two bishops at equal distances, it devolves upon the senior of these. In accordance with the terms
of a royal decree dated April 22, 1705, it is ordered that the expenses incurred by the prelates on their episcopal visits
are to be met by the royal treasury. The manner in which the <i lang="es">espolios</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3800src" href="#xd0e3800">3</a> are collected was determined by a royal decree, dated June 24, 1821.

</p>
<p>The secular clergy is divided into parochial and non-parochial. In the latter class are included the persons employed in the
metropolitan cathedral; to the same class belong the four provisors of the other dioceses.

</p>
<p>The provisor or vicar-general of this diocese holds the title of judge of chaplains, but that title is not held by the provisors
of the other bishoprics.

</p>
<p>By a general rule, the provisors of the respective dioceses are directors of the conciliar seminaries; but that is not the
case with the provisor of this archbishopric, who is at present dean of the cathedral. The presidents of the said establishments
are, as a rule, also procurators of the same. The commissary of the crusade and the attorney-general of the ecclesiastical
court are at present members of the choir of the cathedral of Manila&#8212;as are also the rector of the college of San Jos&eacute;, and
the secretary and the vice-secretary of the archbishop. But this circumstance does not constitute a general rule, as it is
a purely personal favor. Among the employees of the ecclesiastical court of Manila are five chief notaries&#8212;of whom one is
pensioned [<i lang="es">jubilado</i>], another despatches the business relative to the tribunal of the crusade, and the three remaining ones form part of the
ecclesiastical courts suffragan to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>this archbishopric. There are, further, two secretaries of the diocesan courts of Manila and Cebu&#8212;the latter being a modern
creation, as are also a vice-secretary of the archbishop, and a vice-secretary of the bishop of Nueva C&aacute;ceres; also an archivist
of the archbishop, a commissary-general of the crusade, eight royal chaplains (inclusive of the chaplain-in-chief), one supernumerary,
and the father sacristan; and twelve employees in the seminaries of the four bishoprics, with the name of directors, presidents,
rectors, vice-rectors, lecturers, and sacristans. To this number one must add ten more who proceed from the three colleges
and the university&#8212;who bear the titles of rector, professors, readers, secretary, and master of ceremonies&#8212;and thirty chaplains.
In the latter number are included those who serve in the detachments of the army; those assigned for the colleges, hospitals,
and hospitiums; and those who are paid by certain corporations, such as the Audiencia, etc. In this number those of the royal
chapel are not included; for their institution is to provide their divisions, and the boats of the fleet, with priests when
those of the former class are lacking. Their total amounts to ninety-three.

</p>
<p>Coming now to the seminarists, their number cannot be determined, for it varies every year. But by adopting an average for
the students in the conciliar seminary of Manila in 1842 and 48 [<i>sic</i>; 43?]&#8212;namely, some twenty-five, counting priests, deacons, subdeacons, those who have taken the lesser orders, and those
who have taken the tonsure&#8212;one may calculate that the four seminaries will contain about one hundred students; so that, adding
these to the ninety-three preceding, belonging also to the secular clergy, the number increases to one hundred and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>ninety-three. There are also in each one of the bishoprics some secular ecclesiastics employed under the immediate orders
of the diocesans, who bear the name of pages, cross-bearers, etc., whose number cannot be determined. One is also unable to
calculate the number of those who have been ordained under the title of patrimony,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3823src" href="#xd0e3823">4</a> and chaplaincies<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3828src" href="#xd0e3828">5</a> of blood or of class, etc. By a royal decree of June 1, 1799, order was given for the curas to pay the three per cent for
the sustenance of the seminaries.

</p>
<p>Before concluding this review, we must also show that there are some arrangements that are common to both secular and regular
clergy&#8212;those which make it indifferent, for the discharge of certain duties or commissions, whether they are secular or regular
priests. Such are outside vicariates, and the chaplaincies of presidios, fortresses, etc.

</p>
<p>From the founding of Manila until it obtained its first bishop there was a space of ten years. Its first prelate was suffragan
to the metropolitan see of M&eacute;jico. But seventeen years after, and twenty-seven from the foundation of the city, in the year
1596, and by means of the bull of Clement VIII, despatched at the proposal of King Don Felipe II, it was separated from that
see, and was erected into a metropolitan, with the three suffragan sees which it has at present.

<h3 class="normal">Bishopric of Ceb&uacute;</h3>
<p>Ceb&uacute;, formerly called Sogbu, is a suffragan bishopric of the archbishopric of Manila, which bounds it on the north. This diocese
was created in 1595, at the same time as those of Nueva Segovia and Nueva C&aacute;ceres, at the request of the monarch, Felipe II,
by brief of his Holiness Clement VIII. Its first bishop was Don Fray Pedro de Agurto, who took possession of this bishopric
on October 14, 1598. He who at present occupies the see is his Excellency Don Romualdo Gimeno, who is governing the diocese
worthily to the honor and glory of God, and the gain of the metropolitan see, having begun his office February 27, 1847. This
diocese includes at present the civil provinces of Ceb&uacute;, Negros, Leyte, Samar, Capiz, Antique, Misamis, Caraga, Nueva-Guip&uacute;zcoa,
Zamboanga, Calamianes, and the Marianas. Among those provinces are counted one hundred and seventy-nine curacies, of which
one hundred and twelve are held by regular missionaries, and fifty-five by seculars (either Indian or mestizo clergy), as
will be seen from chart number 6.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e3844src" href="#xd0e3844">6</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>The ecclesiastical court is composed of a provisor and vicar-general, who is at present the priest Don Esteban Meneses; of
a secretary of the exchequer and of government, which office is filled by Doctor Don Marcos del Rosario; and of a notary,
who is Don Pedro Magno, a priest.

worship assigned to the same.

</p>
<p>The college seminary of San Carlos, which is located in the city of Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Ceb&uacute;&#8212;the capital of the island of its name
and of those called Visayas, and the residence of the most excellent and illustrious bishop, to whose authority and vigilance
are submitted all matters relating to the spiritual part&#8212;has about eighteen or twenty pupils, counting seminarists and collegiates.
In that institution are taught grammatical studies [<i>minimos</i>], syntax, philosophy, and moral theology, whose respective chairs are in charge of learned and industrious professors. The
territory of the civil provinces which form this bishopric is divided into twenty-four outside districts for its better ecclesiastical
administration, eighteen of which are in charge of the parish priests of the following villages: in the province of Negros,
those of Jimamailan and Siquijor; in the island of Ceb&uacute;, there is one in the city of that name, and the rest in Danao, Barilis,
Siquijor, and Dimiao; in Caraga, that of Bacuag; in the island of Leyte, that of Jilongos or Hilongos, and that of Burauen
or Buraven&#8212;the first on the western coast, and the second on the eastern; in the province of Iloilo, that of Tigbauan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>(which also belongs to the province of Antique), and that of Mandurreao in the province of Capiz, that of Manga or Banga,
and that of Mandalay or Mandalag; in the province of Nisamis, that of Cagayan; and in the Marianas Islands, some three hundred
leguas distant, those of Aga&ntilde;a, Agat, and Rota. In this number are lacking those of the provinces of Nueva-Guip&uacute;zcoa, Calamianes,
and Samar, which can all be thus calculated: at one parish in the first province, as it is of modern creation and thinly populated;
three in the second, as it is composed of various islands; and some two in the last. This is a total of twenty-four vicariates
or outside districts. The ecclesiastics, both secular and regular, appointed to discharge these duties, exercise, in addition
to the functions peculiar to their ministry, the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the villages assigned to their respective
outside districts, which are immediately subordinate to the vicar-general of the diocese, who is the provisor of the same.
It is to be noted, in regard to this ecclesiastical division, that it is found to be subject to continual alterations, in
regard both to the number of ecclesiastical vicariates, and to the curas who discharge these duties.

</p>
<p>The considerable extent of this bishopric, which is the largest in the Filipinas Islands&#8212;whose provinces are widely separated
from one another, some of those provinces even being composed of numerous islets as its separate parts&#8212;has given occasion
for various petitions proposing the division of this bishopric into two parts, as a matter of greater advantage to the Church
and to the State. Apropos of this, the bishop of Ceb&uacute;, Don Fray Santos Gomez Mara&ntilde;on, declared in a respectful representation
which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>addressed to his Majesty, King Don Fernando VII, under date of Ceb&uacute;, August 25, 1831, the following, which we copy:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>&#8220;Sire:

</p>
<p>&#8220;The bishop of Ceb&uacute;, in order to relieve his conscience, finds it necessary to relate to your Majesty with the greatest frankness,
that it appears necessary for the greater service of God, the welfare of souls, and [the service] of your royal person, to
divide into two bishoprics this so extensive and scattered diocese of Visayas&#8212;in whose innumerable islands there are, in his
judgment, more than one million of Christian souls, notwithstanding that the census of the past year shows no more than 858,510
souls. In addition to this there are a multitude of infidels, whom it would not be difficult to civilize and convert, were
there two bishops among them who could take care of their conversion in an efficient manner; for one bishop alone has too
much to look after in the conservation of so many Christians, without other duties. There are three provinces in the island
of Panay alone, in which there are 54 parishes and many annexed villages, who have at least 378,970 souls, besides the heathen.
If there were a permanent bishop in that island, their number would quickly be duplicated.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The prelate could easily visit and confirm the distant provinces of Calamianes and Zamboanga (whither no bishop has as yet
gone, because of their great distance from Ceb&uacute;, and because it is necessary to consume several months [in such a trip] by
reason of the monsoons, thus neglecting other things which require attention) from his see, which could be established <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>in the well-populated village of Jaro.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4109src" href="#xd0e4109">7</a> The islands of Tablas, Sibuyan, Romblon, and Banton, and the western part of the island of Negros, would belong also to this
new bishopric, and Christianity would be considerably increased. The bishop of Ceb&uacute; would not on that account remain with
nothing to do; for besides the island of this name, those of Bojol or Bohol, Leyte, Samar, the laborious island of Surigao,
Misamis, and the eastern part of the island of Negros (where a mission is already established), and various other smaller
islands remain. Thus he retains charge of at least 434,846 souls, besides an infinite number of heathen.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The bishop of Ceb&uacute; is addressing his king and sovereign with all sincerity and frankness; and he can say no less to your
Majesty than that it is impossible for one bishop alone to visit and confirm his people, and to discharge his other pastoral
duties, in all the numerous and intricate islands of Visayas, which have been in his charge until the present&#8212;especially in
the so distant Marianas Islands, which have no communication with Ceb&uacute;. Those islands ought to be assigned to the archbishopric
of Manila, with which capital is their only communication. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>Even in this case, authority ought to be conceded to their ecclesiastical superior, with chrism consecrated by the archbishop,
over all the Christians who live there.

</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the writer was consecrated in Manila, he set out to visit his bishopric. I visited the island of Romblon, and
the three provinces of the island of Panay, confirming in those islands 102,636 persons; the island of Negros and half of
Ceb&uacute;, in which two districts 1 confirmed 23,800, as I inform your Majesty by a separate letter. I have employed one-half year
in this first visit, without the loss of a second of time, taking advantage of the good season.

</p>
<p>&#8220;I am intending to conclude the visit for the half of this island during the monsoon of the coming year; and to continue my
visit to the islands of Bojol, Leyte, Samar, Surigao, and Misamis. But notwithstanding the efforts of the bishop, and his
desire to fulfil his obligations, he cannot visit Zamboanga or Calamianes, and much less the Marianas islands&#8212;so many souls
remaining without the sacrament of the confirmation and benediction of their bishop, as it is impossible to visit them.

</p>
<p>&#8220;With what conscience, Sire, will you abandon him who dares to call out before your Majesty&#8217;s throne, asking you, as so Catholic
[a sovereign], and as the patron of all the churches of the Indias, to remedy this evil? The bishop of Ceb&uacute; finds no other
remedy than the creation of another bishopric, and the division into two parts of this most extensive diocese, as he has already
declared. Consequently he proposes it, in order to lay the burden of his conscience on that of your Majesty; and so that he
may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>not have to give account for his negligence to the Supreme Judge. If your Majesty considers it fitting to approve this so
useful and even so necessary proposition, your bishop is of the opinion, as he has already intimated, that the see of the
new bishopric can be determined, and that it may be entitled the bishopric of Panay or of Jaro&#8212;which is a well-populated village,
as I have said above. Its foundation and administration belongs to the calced Augustinian fathers, as does that of almost
all the villages of that so fierce and fertile island. Your Majesty might show it the favor to allow it to be entitled hereafter
&#8217;the Christian city.&#8217;

</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the Augustinian fathers have been the first conquistadors and founders of the greater part of the villages of Visayas,
and even of those of the island of Luzon, it appears to be the most natural thing that the first bishop be a calced Augustinian;
and that he should know the language of the country, so that he can sooner establish this new bishopric in better order, civilization,
and increase of Christianity, and tributes.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, this aged bishop expects this, Sire, from the pure Catholicity of your Majesty, and from your ardent zeal for
the increase of the Christian church and of prosperity in these your so distant dominions&#8212;which have always shown themselves
so loyal and constant, even in the midst of so many revolutions, to their beloved king and sovereign; and he even dares, knowing
your Majesty&#8217;s goodness of heart, to propose three Augustinian fathers who have accomplished much for the happiness of these
Visayas Islands, so that your Majesty may choose one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>the three; for any one of them would completely fulfil your royal desires.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal is sent under other covers, and I am sending it to his Excellency, the vice-patron, for his approval. But the
decision of your Majesty, on whose delicate conscience your bishop of Ceb&uacute; places this whole matter, and [thus] relieves his
own conscience, will always be the most suitable one. May God, etc.&#8221;
</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p>If the creation of a new bishopric was considered as an absolute necessity at that time, in order that the Christian church
in the so numerous islands might be better attended to, with how much more reason cannot the present bishop and his successors
solicit this grace from his Majesty, since the population has increased to about double what it was then&#8212;and especially since
new provinces have been created, and most of their wandering tribes, scattered throughout most of the islands in the jurisdiction
of this diocese, conquered for God. We believe also, with that venerable bishop, that the division of this extensive bishopric
into two parts is highly advisable (<i>for</i> it is wellnigh impossible for any diocesan to visit his so numerous and scattered flock)&#8212;not only in the interests of religion,
but also in those of the State, inasmuch as the former is preserved by their vigilance and authority purer and more incorruptible
from the vices that have invaded it on more than one occasion; and the country will increase in wealth and prosperity, in
proportion as the numerous nomadic tribes, who are yet wandering through the rough thickets, are reduced to the social life.

<h3 class="normal">Nueva C&aacute;ceres</h3>
<p>Nueva C&aacute;ceres, or Camarines, is one of the three of the present ecclesiastical divisions of the island of Luz&oacute;n. It includes
all the eastern part of that island, and the adjacent islands, as we shall presently see. It extends from the sea on the west,
at the mouth of the strait of Mindoro, where it is bounded by the archbishopric of Manila&#8212;as likewise in the interior, where
pass its northern limits, the only boundaries that it has within the land&#8212;to the eastern sea in the extreme southeast of the
province of Caraga,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4150src" href="#xd0e4150">8</a> also the boundaries of the archbishopric. However, it has jurisdiction in the village of Baler and in that of Casiguran,
in the province of Nueva Ecija; and those of Polillo and Binango&ntilde;an de Lampon, in Laguna. For the rest, it is surrounded by
the sea and indented with numerous bays. Beginning at the mouth of the above-mentioned strait (where it is bounded by the
archbishopric), the first part of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Nueva C&aacute;ceres is the bay formed by the point of Galban,
belonging to the province of Batangas, and the headland of Boudol.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4156src" href="#xd0e4156">9</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>It follows the bay of Peris as far as Guinayangan, which lies in the same angle of the bay, where the province of Tayabas
ends. Then follows the village of Ba&ntilde;gsa, which belongs to the province of Camarines, next to which is found the province
of Albay. The bishopric follows the coast until it meets the bay of Sorsogon. Beyond that bay is seen that of Bulsnan and
then that of Albay (which is beyond the Embocadero of San Bernardino), which is formed by the islet called Baga Rey and the
point of Montufar. Then follow the bay of Malinao and the point of Tigbi, where the province of Camarines begins again. This
point and that of Lognoy form the mouth of the bay of Bala. Past the point of San Miguel is seen the bay of Naga, where the
city of Nueva C&aacute;ceres was located. That great bay is formed by the point of Siroma, and is seventy-six leguas round to the
point of Talisay. Six leguas from that point is the bay of Da&eacute;t, into which flows a river of great volume, which comes down
from the highlands. Following this coast there is a small bay into which empties a river which flows from the mountain of
Paracale, well known for its gold mines. About six leguas from that river is seen Punta del Diablo [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Point&#8221;], so called because of the shoals that run out into the sea, which are very dangerous. Past that point is
the river of Capalonga,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4167src" href="#xd0e4167">10</a> where the province of Camarines ends and that of Tayabas begins again. At this point the sea runs inland and forms an isthmus
only five leguas [wide] with the sea of Visayas. That small gulf is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>found in the sea of Gumaca; it is very rough, and along its coast are found the villages of Gumaca, Atimonan, and Mambau [<i>sc.</i> Maub&aacute;n]. Going north, one meets the island of Polo [<i>i.e.</i>, Polillo?], the bay of Lampon, and the villages of Baler and Casiguran, the last ones of this ecclesiastical jurisdiction&#8212;which,
as we said, are situated in the province of Nueva-Ecija. Then is encountered the point of San Ildefonso, the boundary at which
meet the bishoprics of Nueva C&aacute;ceres and Nueva Segovia.

</p>
<p>This bishopric was founded by a bull of Clement VIII, dated August 14, 1595. Four thousand pesos&#8217; salary was assigned to the
bishopric annually, payable from the royal treasury of M&eacute;jico, as there were no tithes in Filipinas because the Indians did
not pay them, and the Spaniards cared but little for the cultivation of the lands. A salary of one hundred and eighty pesos
was assigned to the cura of the cathedral, and ninety-two to the sacristan. Two honorary chaplains were also created, to assist
in the pontifical celebration; and they were assigned salaries of one hundred pesos apiece. The bishop resided in Nueva C&aacute;ceres,
in the province of Camarines, which was founded by the governor Francisco de Sande; but no other trace of that city has remained
than the Indian village called Naga, which is the capital of the province and where the see is also located. It has a cathedral
and episcopal palace of stone, and a conciliar seminary for the secular clergy of the country. Its jurisdiction extends throughout
the provinces of Camarines (Norte and Sur), Tayabas, and Albay; the politico-military commandancy of Masbate and Ticao; the
islands of Burias and Catanduanes; and the villages of Baler and Casiguran <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>in Nueva Ecija, and Polillo and Binongonan de Lampon in Laguna. In this vast territory, the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
Nueva C&aacute;ceres includes the following provinces, curacies, and villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4182src" href="#xd0e4182">11</a>

</p>
<p>Besides the assignments which were made from the beginning, as we have said, to this bishopric, and which are at present paid
from the royal treasuries of the colony, there is allowed to the miter 500 pesos for the relief of poor curas; 400 pesos to
expend on the building of the cathedral and other objects; 135 pesos 2 reals for wax, oil, etc.&#8212;the total amount being equal
to 5,516 pesos, 7 silver reals, and 37 maraved&iacute;s.

</p>
<p>The name of this bishopric is preserved solely in official documents, that of Camarines prevailing, as it is the name of the
province where the bishop lives. [The names of the bishops of this bishopric until 1848 follow.]

</p>
<p>The diocesan visits are to be made at the account of the royal treasury, in accordance with the royal decree of April 22,
1705. When the episcopal see becomes vacant, inasmuch as it has no cabildo its government belongs to his Excellency the metropolitan
archbishop, who appoints a provisor or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>capitular vicar. If the archiepiscopal see should be vacant at the same time also, the government would pertain to the nearest
suffragan; and if distances be equal, to the senior of these.

</p>
<p>The form of administering and collecting the income was prescribed in a royal decree dated June 24, 1712, as has been stated
elsewhere in this work.

<div class="div2" id="xd0e4263">
<h3 class="normal">Nueva Segovia</h3>
<p>This is one of the three bishoprics of the island of Luzon. It includes the provinces of Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Pangasinan,
Union, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Abra, and the Batanes Islands. This diocese extends throughout the northern part of the island,
from longitude 123&deg; 21&#8217; on the western coast, where the point called Pedregales is located, to 126&deg; 5&#8217; on the eastern or opposite
coast, where the point Maamo projects; and from latitude 16&deg; 17 to 18&deg; 38&#8217;. It is bounded on the south by the archbishopric
of Manila, to which belong the provinces of Zambales and Pampanga, on the extreme west and northeast. On the southeast it
descends to latitude 15&deg; 30&#8217;, to point of Dicapinisan and to Nueva Ecija, with that of Nueva C&aacute;ceres or Camarines in the upper
limits of the province of Tayabas. It is also bounded on the east by the archbishopric [of Manila] in the above-mentioned
province of Nueva Ecija. Its boundaries on the west and north are maritime. Beginning where this last province ends (which
may be considered as the point of Dicapinisan), the opposite coast offers nothing more noteworthy than the bays of Dibut and
Baler until one reaches that of Casiguran; and there is nothing worthy of mention. When one leaves this last bay, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>he must double the cape of San Ildefonso, where the ancient ecclesiastical jurisdiction of this bishopric began. Continuing
north for a matter of some sixteen nautical leguas, one meets the port of Tumango, the safest and most capacious of all this
rough coast. A short distance from that port are found the village of Palanan and the missions of Dicalayon, and Dauilican
or Divilican. Thence, until one reaches the cape of Enga&ntilde;o,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4270src" href="#xd0e4270">12</a> one finds nothing more than some small anchoring-places, which offer but scant refuge to the vessels, as they are all exposed
to the vendavals. On the northern coast as well, which begins at the said cape of Enga&ntilde;o (so called because of the deceitfulness
of its currents), one does not meet bay or port until he reaches the village of Aparri, some fifteen leguas away. This village
is located a short distance from the ancient city of Nueva Segovia, which is known to the natives under the name of Laen [sc.
Lal-l&oacute;]. A matter of fifteen leguas more from the above village of Aparri, is encountered the beginning of the Caraballos
mountains, whose point, called Balaynacira, or Pata, projects into the northern sea and is the most northern point of the
island. At this point ends the province of Cagayan, and begins that of Ilocos Norte, in the village of Pancian which is nine
hours&#8217; distance from that of Bangui. Then one doubles the cape of Bojeador, where the western coast of the island begins,
and passes the provinces of Ilocos (Norte and Sur), Union, and Pangasinan, which abound with many villages, until the cape
of Bolinao is reached&#8212;where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>this bishopric is bounded by the archbishopric, to which belongs the province of Zambales.

</p>
<p>This see suffragan to the metropolitan of Manila was erected by brief of his Holiness Clement VIII, August 14, 1595. The bishop
formerly resided in Nueva Segovia, the capital of the province of Cagayan; but now he resides at Vigan, the capital of Ilocos
Sur, where the town called Fernandina formerly stood. The endowment for this miter is four thousand pesos fuertes for the
diocesan, one hundred and eighty-four pesos for the cura of the cathedral, ninety-two pesos to the sacristan, and one hundred
pesos to each one of the chaplains of the choir. Its jurisdiction extends, as we have said, through the eight provinces of
Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Pangasinan, Union, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Abra, and the Batanes Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4277src" href="#xd0e4277">13</a>...

</p>
<p>[The name Nueva Segovia is preserved only in official documents, and it is more frequently called the bishopric of Ilocos,
from the name of the province where the bishop lives. The names of the bishops until 1849 follow, and the article ends with
information identical with that concluding the article on the bishopric of Nueva C&aacute;ceres.]

<h3 class="normal">Chapter Twelve</h3>
<h3 class="normal">Travels in Camarines Sur. Description of the province. Spanish priests. Alcaldes and mandarins.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4382src" href="#xd0e4382">1</a></h3>
<p>The convents are large, magnificent buildings, whose curas at that time&#8212;for the most part, elderly men&#8212;were most hospitable
and amiable. It was necessary to stop at each convent, and the father in charge of it had his horses harnessed and drove his
guest to his next colleague. I wished to hire a boat at Pol&aacute;ngui to go to the lake of Batu;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4386src" href="#xd0e4386">2</a> but there was none to be had. Only two large, eighty-foot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291">291</a>]</span><i>barotos</i>, each hollowed from a single tree-trunk and laden with rice from Camarines, lay there. In order that I might not be detained,
the father bought the cargo of one of the boats, on condition that it be immediately unladed; thus I was able to proceed on
my journey in the afternoon.

</p>
<p>If the traveler is on good terms with the cura, he will seldom have any trouble. I was once about to take a little journey
with a parish priest directly after lunch. All the preparations were completed at a quarter after eleven. I declared that
it was too bad to wait the three-quarters of an hour for the repast. Immediately after, it struck twelve, and all work in
the village ceased. We, as well as our porters, sat down to table; it was noon. The [following] message had been sent to the
bellringer: &#8220;The father ordered him to be told that he must surely be sleeping again; it must have been twelve o&#8217;clock long
ago, for the father is hungry.&#8221; <i lang="fr">Il est l&#8217;heure que votre Majest&eacute; d&eacute;sire.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e4397src" href="#xd0e4397">3</a>

</p>
<p>Most of the priests in the eastern provinces of Luzon and Samar consist of Franciscan friars,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4402src" href="#xd0e4402">4</a> who are trained in special seminaries in Spain for the missions in the colonies. Formerly, they were at liberty to return
to their fatherland after ten years&#8217; residence in the Philippines. But since the convents have been suppressed in Spain,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4405src" href="#xd0e4405">5</a> this is no longer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>allowed them; for there they would be compelled to renounce the rules of their order, and live as private persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4412src" href="#xd0e4412">6</a> They know that they must end their days in the colonies, and regulate themselves accordingly. At their arrival they are usually
sent to a priest in the province, so that they may study the native language. Then they first receive a small and later a
profitable curacy, in which they generally remain for the rest of their life. Most of these men spring from the lowest rank
of the people. Numerous existing pious foundations in Spain make it possible for the poor man, who cannot pay for schooling
for his son, to send him to the seminary, where he learns nothing outside of the special service for which he is trained.
Were the friars of a finer culture, as are a part of the English missionaries, they would, for that reason, have but little
inclination to mix with the people, and consequently would not obtain over them the influence that they generally have. The
early habits of life of the Spanish friars, and their narrow horizon, quite peculiarly fit them to live among the natives.
It is exactly for the above reason that they have so well established their power over those people.

</p>
<p>When the above-mentioned young men come quite fresh from their seminaries, they are incredibly narrow, ignorant, and at times
ill-mannered, full of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>conceit, hatred for heretics, and desire to proselyte. Gradually this rough exterior wears away; and their estimable position,
and the abundant emoluments which they enjoy, make them kindly disposed. The sound insight into human nature and the self-reliance
which are peculiar to the lower classes of the Spanish people, and which are so amusingly revealed by Sancho Panza as governor,
have full opportunity to assert themselves in the influential and responsible post which the cura occupies. Very frequently
the cura is the only white man in the place, and no other European lives for miles around. Therefore, not only is he the curator
of souls, but also the representative of the government. He is the oracle of the Indians, and his special decision in anything
that concerns Europe and civilization is without appeal. His advice is asked in all important affairs, and he has no one from
whom he himself can seek advice. Under such circumstances all their intellectual abilities come into full play. The same man,
who would have followed the plow in Spain, here [<i>i.e.</i>, in the Philippines] carries out great undertakings. Without technical instruction and without scientific help, he constructs
churches, roads, and bridges. However, although these circumstances are so favorable for the development of the ability of
the priest, yet it would be better for the buildings themselves if they were executed by professionals; for the bridges collapse
readily, the churches often resemble sheep-folds, the more pretentious have at times most extravagant fa&ccedil;ades, and the roads
quickly deteriorate again. However, each one does as well as he can. Almost all of them have the good of their village at
heart, although their zeal, and the course followed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>by those who pursue this aim, differ widely according to their personality. In Camar&iacute;nes and Alb&aacute;y, I have had considerable
intercourse with the curas, and they have, without exception, won my esteem. As a rule, they have no self-conceit; and in
the remote places they are so happy whenever they receive a visit, that they exert all their efforts to make their guest&#8217;s
stay as pleasant as possible. Life in a large convent very much resembles that of the lord of the manor in eastern Europe.
Nothing can be more unconstrained. One lives as independently as in an inn, and many guests act just as if they were in one.
I have seen a subaltern arrive, who, without waiting until the steward assigned him a room of his own accord, took one himself,
ordered his dinner, and only casually asked whether the priest, with whom he was only very slightly acquainted, was at home.

</p>
<p>Frequently the priests in the Philippines are upbraided about their gross licentiousness. [It is said that] the convent is
full of beautiful girls, with whom the cura lives like a sultan. This might often be so of the native priests; but at the
houses of numerous Spanish priests whose guest I have been, I have never once happened to see anything objectionable in this
regard. Their servants were only men, and perhaps an old woman or two. Ribabeneyra asserts:<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4429src" href="#xd0e4429">7</a> &#8220;The Indians, who observe how the discalced friars maintain their chastity, have come in their thoughts to the conclusion
that they are not men ... and although the devil has endeavored to corrupt many chaste priests now deceased, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>and also those who still live, making use of the shamelessness of some Indian women for that purpose, yet the friars remained
victorious, to the great shame of the Indian women and of Satan.&#8221; However, this author is very unreliable. He says further
(chapter iii, page 13), that the island of Cebu is known under another name as Luzon! At any rate, his description does not
fit the present conditions. The young priest lives in his parish as did the lord of the manor in earlier times. The girls
consider it an honor for themselves to associate with him. The opportunity is very favorable for him, for he is watched over
by no jealous wife; and, as the father confessor and priestly adviser, he has opportunity at discretion to be alone with the
women.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4436src" href="#xd0e4436">8</a> The confessional must especially be a perilous rock for them. In the appendix to a Tag&aacute;l grammar (which is lacking in those
copies intended for public sale), is a list of questions for the young priest who is not yet conversant with the language,
which he must propound to the persons confessing. Several pages of those questions relate to sexual intercourse.

</p>
<p>As the alcaldes are allowed to stay in a province only three years, they never understand the language of the country; for
they are very much in demand because of their official business, and have no time (and usually no desire) to study the peculiarities
of the province which they administer. The cura, on the other hand, lives in the midst of his parishioners, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>whom he knows thoroughly, and whom he also represents against the government. Consequently, it happens that he is the real
authority in his district. The position of the priests, in contradistinction to that of the government officials, is bespoken
also in their dwellings. The <i lang="es">casas reales</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, royal buildings]&#8212;for the most part small, plain, and often dilapidated&#8212;are not in keeping with the rank of the first officials
of the province. The convent, however, is usually a very large, imposing, and well-furnished building. Formerly, when the
governorships were sold to adventurers, whose only thoughts were to enrich themselves from that office, the influence of the
priests was even much greater than at present.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4452src" href="#xd0e4452">9</a> The following ordinances point out their former position better than long descriptions.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Although certain outrageous offenses have given fitting reason for chapter x of the ordinances, wherein Governor Don Pedro
de Arandia orders that the alcaldes and justices shall have no other communication with the missionaries than in writing,
and shall not visit them except in company, it is also nevertheless ordered that they shall not do the latter ... on the assumption
that the prelates of the church shall employ all their energies in restraining their subordinates within the bounds of moderation....
The alcaldes shall therefore see to it that the priests and ministers of the above order shall treat the gobernadorcillos
and officers of justice with the proper respect; and they shall not permit the latter to be beaten, chastised, or illtreated
by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>missionaries, ... nor shall they be compelled to serve them at table.&#8221;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4462src" href="#xd0e4462">10</a>

</p>
<p>The former alcaldes who bought their posts, or obtained them through favor, and who had no previous training in official business,
and often no education and intelligence, and who did not possess the necessary mental and moral qualities for so responsible
and influential an office, received a nominal salary from the State, to which they paid a commission for the right to engage
in trade. According to Arenas (p. 444),<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4469src" href="#xd0e4469">11</a> this commission was regarded as a fine on the alcaldes for transgressing the law; &#8220;for since all kinds of trading were forbidden
to them by various laws,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4478src" href="#xd0e4478">12</a> yet also his Majesty was pleased to grant a dispensation for it.&#8221;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4484src" href="#xd0e4484">13</a> This irregularity was first suppressed by royal decrees of September 10 and October 30, 1844.

</p>
<p>The alcaldes were governors and judges, commanders of the troops, and at the same time the only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>traders in their respective provinces.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4491src" href="#xd0e4491">14</a> They bought in Manila the goods that were needed in their provinces&#8212;usually with the money of the charities [<i lang="es">obras pias</i>] (see p. 14, note 17);<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4497src" href="#xd0e4497">15</a> for they themselves came to the Philippines without any property. The Indians were compelled to sell their products to the
alcalde, and to buy his wares at the prices which the latter established.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4518src" href="#xd0e4518">16</a> In such circumstances, the priests were the only ones who protected the Indians against these bloodsuckers, when they did
not (as sometimes happened) also make common cause with the alcaldes.

</p>
<p>At present the government sends men who know the law to act as alcaldes in the Philippines, who are somewhat better paid and
are not allowed to trade.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the whole, the government is endeavoring to lessen the influence of the curas, in order to strengthen the civil authorities;
but that will be only very imperfectly accomplished, however, unless the tenure of office of the alcaldes be lengthened, and
the office be so assigned that the alcaldes will have no temptation to make money on the side.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4528src" href="#xd0e4528">17</a>

is inaccurate in many places, and that it was done in a careless and slovenly manner. Consequently, it has been necessary
to translate this matter directly from the German.

direction from Lake Bat&oacute; (the Batu of the text). This passage, in the English translation mentioned in the preceding note,
is incorrectly rendered, &#8220;to cross the lake of Batu&#8221;&#8212;an error probably due to ignorance on the part of the translator, of

of October 11, of the same year. The suppression, as might have been expected, was accompanied by excesses against the friars
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e4407" href="#xd0e4407">276n</a>]</span>nuns, and some of them were murdered, while parish priests and Jesuits were hunted over the borders.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href="#xd0e4412src" id="xd0e4412">6</a></span> This passage is hopelessly confused in the English translation, and proves how entirely untrustworthy that translation is.

enterprises, until the premiums&#8212;which for the risk to Acapulco reached 50 per cent, to China, 25 per cent, and to the Indias,
35 per cent&#8212;had increased the original capital to a certain amount. Then the interest of that amount was to be applied to
the good of the soul of the founder, or to pious or charitable ends (Arenas, <i lang="es">Historia</i>, p. 397). One-third was usually retained as a reserve, to cover chance losses. These reserve funds were long ago claimed
by the government as compulsory loans, &#8216;but they are still regarded as existing.&#8217;

<p class="footnote">&#8220;When the trade with Acapulco came to an end, the capitals could no longer be employed in accordance with the request of the

less than one million dollars [<i>i.e.</i>, pesos]. From that amount the profit obtained from the loans is distributed according to the amount of the original capital&#8212;which

<h3 class="normal">Archbishopric of Manila</h3>
<p>In this archbishopric the Recollect fathers have charges in the provinces of Manila, Cavite, Laguna, the district of Morong,
Bataan, Pampanga, Zambales, and Mindoro.

</p>
<p>[In the province of Manila, they have (1878) charges in the following villages: La Hermita, with 1,767&frac12; tributes, and 6,747
souls; Las-Pi&ntilde;as, with 1,149&frac12; tributes, and 4,771 souls; and Caloocan, with 2,166 tributes, and 7,511 souls.]

<h4>District of Morong</h4>
<p>This district, which is governed by a political and military commander (who is at the same time administrator of the public
funds), takes its name from its capital village, which is located on the shore of the lake of Bay. This district was created
in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three. The villages of this district which are located on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>the lake are under the care of Franciscan fathers; Angono, Cainta, Jalajala, and Bosoboso of seculars; and we ourselves possess
the two following. [These are the villages of Antipolo, with 1,074 tributes, and 3,547 souls; and Taytay, with 2,479 tributes,
and 8,435 souls.]


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e4572">
<h4>Province of Bataan</h4>
<p>This province is located in the island of Luz&oacute;n, and is bounded on the north by the provinces of Pampanga and Zambales, on
the east by the bay of Manila, and on the south and west by the sea of China. It is governed by an alcalde, and is in charge
of the Dominican fathers, with the exception of Mariveles, Bagac, and Morong, which are in charge of the Recollect fathers.

</p>
<p>The missionaries of our corporation performed their first labors of conquest in this territory. Here were founded the oldest
villages on our list; and here took place the first persecutions of our long-suffering predecessors, who had the glory of
watering with their blood the country that they were evangelizing, the one that furnished to the province of San Nicol&aacute;s their
protomartyr.

</p>
<p>Fray Miguel de Santa Maria, accompanied by Father Pedro de San Jos&eacute; (who, although he had been a calced Augustinian, had become
a Recollect in Manila), and by brother Fray Francisco de Santa M&oacute;nica, were the first to leave the convent of San Juan de
Bagumbayan; and prepared by prayer and penance, and full of the spirit of God, set forth to announce His mysteries to the
idolaters and heathen, sent legitimately to the mountains of Mariveles to illumine its inhabitants with the light of the Catholic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>faith. They found those natives enveloped in the most barbarous idolatry, adoring the sun, the moon, the cayman, and other
filthy animals. These people regarded certain old men, as corrupt and as deceived as the divinities whom they were serving,
as the ministers of those deceitful gods. The customs of those people were very analogous to the doctrines that directed them.
Every kind of superstition was practiced; homicide was a praiseworthy and meritorious action; and their sacrifices on some
occasions were human lives. In that vineyard so filled with wickedness the above-mentioned fathers announced the triune and
one God, the mystery of the incarnation, and the eternal duration of the future life. The missionaries suffered more than
one can tell from the inhabitants, who were opposed to and stubborn toward their teaching. In their bodies did they submit
to hunger, and to the intemperance and inclemency of the elements; and in their truly apostolic spirit they suffered mortal
anguish because of the blindness of their neighbors, which was in proportion to the great love of God and the zeal for His
glory which glowed brightly in their hearts.

</p>
<p>[The Recollects have charge of the villages of Mariveles, with 588 tributes, and 1,852 souls; Morong, with 870 tributes, and
3,154 souls; and Bagac, with 496&frac12; tributes, and 1,743 souls.]

<h4>Province of Zambales</h4>
<p>This province is located in the island of Luz&oacute;n, north of Manila. It is bounded on the north by the gulf of Lingayen and the
province of Pangasinan, on the east by the chain of mountains called Mariveles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>on the south by Bataan, and on the west by the Chinese Sea; and is more than thirty leguas long in a north and south direction,
and seven wide.

</p>
<p>The preaching of the Recollects in this territory is mingled with the beginnings of that religious family in the Filipino
archipelago. One may say that this was the region where the first discalced missionaries and the parishes established by them
tasted the first-fruits of their evangelizing zeal, those first-fruits being offered to the Catholic church as a testimony
of the purity of their doctrine, and submitted to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a as its most faithful and disinterested vassals, Although
they arrived at these shores in the year one thousand six hundred and six, in the following year they had already overrun
this province&#8212;to whose inhabitants they taught the mysteries of our religion, and gave helpful instructions in the social
life, in contradistinction to their barbarous state.

</p>
<p>The first who sowed the seed of the gospel in the province of Zambales were the calced Augustinian fathers. Because of the
lack of the above religious, the captain-general of these islands and their metropolitan cabildo entreated the vicar-provincial
of the Recollects to assign religious for the spiritual cultivation of that unfilled vineyard. In the year one thousand six
hundred and nine, our laborers went to Zambales, although visits had been made two years previously by those who were laboring
in the province of Bataan, in order to increase the gospel seed. The meekness and resignation of the fathers in the midst
of so much wretchedness and hardship arrested the attention of those barbarians; and the fathers succeeded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>in catechizing and converting many through their gentleness and kind treatment, and reduced them to settlements.

</p>
<p>The Recollect fathers were charged with the spiritual administration of this province until the year one thousand six hundred
and seventy-nine. In that year, being obliged to go to take charge of the province of Mindoro, and to preach the holy gospel
there, they were forced to hand over the missions of Zambales&#8212;eleven in number&#8212;to the Dominican fathers, who assumed charge
of them.

</p>
<p>After the lapse of some years, and without explanation of the causes which could induce the above-mentioned Dominican fathers
to cease to give spiritual food to those Christian communities with their accustomed zeal, it is a fact that the discalced
Augustinians again took charge of that province, by the month of October, one thousand seven hundred and twelve; and again
undertook the direction and continuation of their spiritual conquests until the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five,
when they were compelled once more to leave it, for lack of religious. The secular priests assumed the missions, with the
exception of the mission of Botolan, which was retained by the Recollects until one thousand eight hundred and fourteen. There
was a residence for the missionaries in each of the villages, and even in various visitas there were suitable churches and
convents of cut stone, when we left this province in the last century. On assuming it anew in the year one thousand eight
hundred and thirty-six, the father provincial of the Recollects, Fray Bl&aacute;s de las Mercedes, attested that only ruins and desolation
were found. Since that time they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>have labored without ceasing in the beautifying and adorning of the house of God, restoring the old ruins and building anew;
until they have succeeded in making the churches worthy the majesty of the Catholic worship&#8212;already having, besides, suitable
edifices for the residences of their missionaries.

</p>
<p>[The order has the spiritual charge of the following villages: Subic, with 761&frac12; tributes, and 2,749 souls; Castillejos, with
917&frac12; tributes, and 4,013 souls; San Marcelino, with 1,165&frac12; tributes, and 4,847 souls; San Antonio, with 1,053 tributes, and
4,722 souls; San Narciso, with 1,564&frac12; tributes, and 7,597 souls; San Felipe, with 1,262 tributes, and 5,063 souls; Cabangaan,
with 685 tributes, and 2,584. souls; Iba, with 1,007 tributes, and 3,896 souls; Palauig, with 761 tributes, and 3,380 souls;
Botolan, with 1,374 tributes, and 5,200 souls; Masinloc, with 1,647 tributes, and 6,541 souls; Bolinao, with 1,795 tributes,
and 5,971 souls; Bani, with 1,036&frac12; tributes, and 4,288 souls; Santa Cruz, with 1,753&frac12; tributes, and 7,366 souls; Balincaguin,

<h4>Province of Cavite</h4>
<p>Coincident with the time of their arrival at Manila, the discalced Augustinians began to labor in the conversion of the infidels
who inhabit the provinces conterminous to the capital. They dedicated themselves with apostolic zeal to the preaching of the
gospel and the administration of the sacraments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>with their gaze directed to the needs of the future. They paid attention to what would be found by experience, in succeeding
times, to be a convenience and a necessity&#8212;namely, to have convents of the Observance in the most important settlements of
the archipelago, in order to give shelter to the religious worn out in the tasks of preaching; while at the same time those
houses were to serve as the base for their premeditated plan, to establish in these islands the corporation of which they
were members, in a perfectly organized condition.

</p>
<p>They founded the convent of Cavite, by apostolic and royal authority, in the year one thousand six hundred and sixteen. It
was dedicated to St. Nicholas of Tolentino, was constructed solidly, and was spacious, with a church which was suitable for
the functions of worship. Cavite was a suitable point, because of its great commerce and the foreigners who go there in throngs.
Thus, with their good example and indefatigable zeal, they could do much good to needy souls.

</p>
<p>This convent was at first supported by the alms of the faithful; and afterward it acquired some incomes of its own through
the gifts of various devout persons, in houses, shops, and plots of ground.

</p>
<p>In the year one thousand seven hundred and nine, Don Pascual Bautista and other inhabitants of that port founded the brotherhood
of our father Jesus in this church.

</p>
<p>The first prior of this convent was Father Andr&eacute;s del Espiritu Santo, who was born in Valladolid, in January, one thousand
five hundred and eighty-five, his parents being Don Hernando Fanego and Do&ntilde;a Elena de Toro. He studied philosophy there, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>asked for the religious habit in our convent of Portillo in the year one thousand six hundred, and professed in that convent
the following year. He devoted himself to the study of the Holy Scriptures in the convent of Nava until the year one thousand
six hundred and five, when he determined to offer himself for the conversion of the Indians, in the mission that was about
to go to Filipinas. Having been assigned to the province of Zambales, he uttered the first words of his apostolic preaching
at Masinloc in the year one thousand six hundred and seven, where he succeeded in converting and baptizing two thousand people,
in founding a village, and in erecting a dwelling and a church with the advocacy of St. Andrew the apostle, November eighteen,
one thousand six hundred and seven. In the year one thousand six hundred and nine, without abandoning his parish, he had to
aid Father Jer&oacute;nimo de Cristo in the reduction of Bolinao; and when after a short time the latter died, he was appointed vicar-provincial,
although continuing to care for and to increase his flock at Bolinao, where he succeeded in converting one thousand six hundred
souls. He concluded his charge in the year one thousand six hundred and twelve; and in the year one thousand six hundred and
fifteen he was elected vicar-provincial for the second time. In that term he finished the establishment of the convent of
Cavite, constructing an edifice of stone with a dwelling to accommodate ten religious. In the year one thousand six hundred
and eighteen, at the completion of his term as superior, he was chosen commissary to the court of Madrid. There he accomplished,
with great success, not only the negotiations for despatches suitable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>for the mission, but the selection of the men whom he conducted [to Filipinas] in the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-two.
As soon as he reached Manila he was again elected superior [and held that position] until the celebration of the first provincial
chapter, on February six, one thousand six hundred and twenty-four, when he was elected first definitor. In the year one thousand
six hundred and twenty-six he was elected provincial; he visited the ministries during his term, and began the missions of
Japon. He made great improvements and additions in the churches and convents of Manila and Calumpang; and labored greatly
in repairing the church and convent of Cebu, which had suffered from a fire. He was elected provincial for the second time,
in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-two, and definitor in the chapter of thirty-five. In the year thirty-eight
he asked to be allowed to retire to a cell, but was elected prior of Manila.

</p>
<p>After the conclusion of that office, he was retired to the convent of Cavite and then to that of Manila, where he died holily
at the beginning of one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight. He was seventy-eight years of age, and fifty-seven in the religious
life, fifty-two of which he employed in the Filipinas Islands, establishing this province on a solid basis of religion.

</p>
<p>[The villages in charge of the Recollects in this province are as follows: Cavite, with 412&frac12; tributes, and 2,319 souls; Imus,
with 3,830 tributes, and 14,439 souls; Cavite-Viejo [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Old Cavite&#8221;], with 2,658 tributes, and 8,265 souls; Rosario, with 2,005 tributes, and 6,906 souls; Bacoor, with 3,959 tributes,
and 13,827 souls; Perez-Dasmari&ntilde;as, with 1,124 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>tributes, and 3,785 souls; Silang, with 2,701&frac12; tributes, and 9,369 souls; Bailen, with 931 tributes, and 3,697 souls; and
Carmona, with 904&frac12; tributes, and 3,101 souls.]

<h4>Province of Batangas</h4>
<p>In this rich province of the island of Luz&oacute;n, flourishing through its products and its active trade with the capital, of extensive
territory and densely populated, the discalced Augustinians were not assigned with the intention of a permanent stay, in the
olden times, to preach the gospel to those natives.

</p>
<p>However, present legislation regarding the service of parish churches in this archipelago has, at the same time while it has
varied in a certain manner our traditional method of support, introduced us into some of the parishes of the province of Batangas;
and at the same time when we have been obliged to cede villages in Visayas&#8212;which were our offspring, and had been converted
by our predecessors, and whose history was identical with the ancient glories of our corporation&#8212;in exchange we have received
parishes organized by the sweat and apostolic fatigues of ministers of the religion of Jesus Christ, who were not members
of our religious family.

</p>
<p>[The villages administered by the Recollects are as follows: Rosario, with 4,259&frac12; tributes, and 17,040 souls; Santo Tom&aacute;s,
with 2,832 tributes, and 9,748 souls; Lobo, with 805&frac12; tributes, and 3,200 souls; and Balayan, with 5,434 tributes, and 24,154

<div class="div3" id="xd0e4643">
<h4>Province of Laguna</h4>
<p>The territory of this province, whose coasts enclose the great lake of Bay, had been administered by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>Franciscan fathers, in most of its extent, from the times of its reduction. But in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-two,
they invited us to share in the ministries on the opposite coast, in the neighborhood of the port of Lampon; and although
those missions were not very desirable, on account of the wretchedness of the country and the small number of tributes, they
were received as very meritorious for heaven, although but little profitable when looked at from a worldly standpoint.

</p>
<p>The Recollect fathers Fray Benito de San Jos&eacute;, Fray Francisco de San Jos&eacute;, and Fray Clemente de San Nicol&aacute;s having been assigned,
with three other companions, to the village of Binangonan, established the first house and church, with the title of San Guillermo;
and two religious remained there. Afterward they went to the village of Baler and established a convent, under the patronage
of St. Nicholas of Tolentino. The third was the village of Casiguran, with the advocacy of our father St. Augustine. The fourth
was established in Palanan, with the title of Santa Mar&iacute;a Magdalena. The discalced Augustinians resided for forty years in
those convents founded on the coasts of the Pacific, exclusively consecrated to the service of God, and the sanctification
of their neighbors, and they attained both objects with great spiritual advantages.

</p>
<p>We had religious there of pure virtue, who were imitating the virtues of the dwellers in the desert. From those missions went
forth our father Fray Bartolom&eacute; de la Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad, son of the convent of Madrid. He lived much retired from intercourse
with men; and when he was elected provincial, in the year one thousand seven hundred and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>one&#8212;at which time all said that he was a person unknown in Manila&#8212;Archbishop Camacho uttered these words: &#8220;The election of
the discalced Augustinians has been and is, properly, an election by God and by the Holy Spirit.&#8221; While so great advance did
the missionaries on the opposite coast make in their own sanctification, not less was the gain in the vineyard entrusted to
their care. They made many Aetas and heathen children of the Catholic church, and directed those souls along the paths of
eternal life. They had the special glory of numbering, among those whom they directed, some privileged women endowed with
the gifts of heaven, and raised by the spirit of God to a height of Christian perfection which confounds our lukewarmness
in His service. One of these was Sister Juana de Jesus, a native of the village of Binangonan de Lampon,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4656src" href="#xd0e4656">1</a> an oblate nun of our order, who elevated herself with the steps of a giant, even to the greatest and most complete purification
of her spirit, by her abstraction from worldly affairs, by her heroic practice of all the virtues, by her fervent daily communion,
and by the most lofty contemplation and the most clear vision that God vouchsafed her of the mysteries of our holy religion.

</p>
<p>In the lamentable period of the missions between the years one thousand six hundred and ninety-two and one thousand seven
hundred and ten, when no religious came to us from Espa&ntilde;a, our Recollect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>family was obliged to abandon this territory which it had in trust, for the lack of evangelical laborers. That action was
taken in the provincial chapter of one thousand seven hundred and four, and the missions above mentioned, which we had served
for more than forty years, were returned to the Franciscans.

</p>
<p>At present we have only the following village in the province of Laguna: [Calauan, with 957&frac12; tributes, and 2,734 souls.]

<h4>Province of Pampanga</h4>
<p>This province, lying north of Manila&#8212;including the district of Tarlac, which was separated from the province in the year one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-three&#8212;is bounded on the north by Pangasinan, on the south by the bay of Manila, on the
east by Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, and on the west by Zambales and Bataan. In this province, which was begun by the Augustinian
Observantine fathers (who still have it in charge), permission to found missions in the mountains of its territory which are
on the Zambales side was granted to the Recollect fathers, by virtue of certain acts that were drawn up in the superior government
without summoning the father provincial, because of the reports of certain persons and the instance of other private individuals.
By those acts the conde de Liz&aacute;rraga, governor of Filipinas, charged the father provincial, Fray Jos&eacute; de San Nicol&aacute;s, to assign
missionaries to the localities of Bamban and Mabalacat. The said father, because of his great experience of these islands
and their inhabitants, explained to the vice-patron the impossibility of those missions living, and the little result <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>that could be expected from them on account of the fierce and untamable nature of the mountaineers. His petition had no effect,
and three missionaries of great merit and learning were sent. By dint of great hardships, and, by living in the same manner
as the Indians, they succeeded in baptizing many; but when they learned the fickleness of the Indian nature, and that it was
as easy for them to become baptized as it was to take to the mountains to continue their former mode of life, the missionaries
proceeded more cautiously in giving them the benefit of the regeneration.

</p>
<p>[In this province the Recollects minister to the following villages: Mabalacat, with 2,627 tributes, and 11,163 souls; Capas,
with 564 tributes, and 1,923 souls; O&#8217;Donnel, with 308&frac12; tributes, and 1,159 souls; and Bolso, with 144 tributes, and 749 souls.]

<div class="div3" id="xd0e4677">
<h4>Province of Mindoro</h4>
<p>This province, directed by an alcalde-mayor, includes the island of the same name, that of Marinduque, that of Luban, and
others less densely populated. Its boundaries are: on the north, the strait of Mindoro; on the east and south, the sea of
Visayas; and on the west, the Chinese Sea.

</p>
<p>In its extent, it is one of the foremost islands of the archipelago. Its land is mountainous, its climate hot; and during
the rainy season it also exceeds other provinces in humidity, whence results the richness of the soil. There are found all
the products of the country in grains and foodstuffs. However, that most fertile country fails of cultivation in its vast
areas because of the scarcity of laborers, and has not been touched by the hand of man. Its conquest was begun in the year
one thousand five hundred and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>seventy, in the district of Mamburao, by Juan de Salcedo; and it was completed the following year, along the coasts from the
cape of Burruncan to that of Calavite, by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. The rest, with the exception of the mountains in its center,
has been gradually subdued by the zeal of the regular missionaries. The calced Augustinian fathers began to diffuse the teaching
of the gospel in this island, and founded the village of Baco, from whose convent the religious went forth to the spiritual
ministry of the converted Indians, who were then very few.

</p>
<p>By cession of the Augustinians, the Franciscan fathers entered this island. The said fathers were not satisfied with preserving
that already reduced, but extended the light of the faith through the districts of Pola and Calavite, until they were transferred
to Camarines and Ilocos by the orders of their superiors.

</p>
<p>The fathers of the Society of Jesus came in to fill the breach left by the Franciscans. They founded the village of Naujan,
which was governed to the great gain of those Christians by Father Luis de San Vitores, who left behind in that point a reputation
for virtue and holiness which was retained for many years among the Indians. That father was withdrawn, to begin the conversion
of the Marianas Islands. His associates followed him, and the Christian souls of Mindoro remained under the direction of the
secular priests who were placed there by the archbishop for their direction.

</p>
<p>When the Recollect fathers had to leave the ministries of Zambales which they had conquered and established at the cost of
their blood and by heroic labors, an order came at that same time from the court of Espa&ntilde;a, decreeing that the island of Mindoro
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>be entrusted to a religious family chosen from those existing in this country. The governor of Filipinas, by the advice of
the archbishop, thought to compensate the Recollects for the loss of their primitive religious conquests in the province of
Zambales, by conferring on them the parishes of Mindoro.

</p>
<p>The Recollects resigned themselves to this disproportionate change, since the exertions made to avoid it availed nothing.
By virtue of the order issued by his Excellency, the captain-general, Don Juan de Vargas, directed to the province of San
Nicol&aacute;s (decreeing that it should take charge of the missions of Mindoro), the then provincial, Fray Jos&eacute; de San Nicol&aacute;s,
assigning laborers for that new acquisition.

</p>
<p>Father Diego de la Madre de Dios was assigned to the district of Baco, which belonged to the bachelor Don Jos&eacute; de Rojas; Father
Diego de la Resureccion, to the curacy of Calavite, taking the place of Licentiate Don Juan Pedrosa; Father Blas de la Concepcion,
to the parish of Naujan, replacing the priest Don Martin Diaz. All the above was effected in the year one thousand six hundred
and seventy-nine.

</p>
<p>The Recollects entered upon the preaching in Mindoro, in obedience to the orders of the government. That was their reason
for believing that their stay in that territory was not to be transitory, but that they could contemplate the organization
of that territory upon foundations intended for its increase and the greater welfare of its inhabitants. For that purpose
they planned to make the best division possible of mother missions and those annexed, assigning for each of the regular missionaries
the barrios and visitas which were nearest his residence, in order that he might aid all of them in their needs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>The apostolate of the Recollects in this island continued without interruption until the year one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-four, when the scarcity of men in the province of San Nicol&aacute;s forced them to renounce it. They reassumed their missions
there in the year one thousand eight hundred and five, when the cause that occasioned their cession ceased to exist.

</p>
<p>[The villages and missions in charge in this province are as follows: Calapan, with 1,335&frac12;, tributes, and 4,495 souls; Naujan,
with 1,687&frac12; tributes, and 5,408 souls; Puerto-Galera, with 544 tributes, and 1,655 souls; Sablayan, with 756&frac12; tributes, and

<h3 class="normal">Bishopric of Jaro</h3>
<p>The provinces of Romblon, Calamianes, and Negros, which are administered by the Recollect fathers, were formerly included
in the spiritual jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sant&iacute;simo Ni&ntilde;o de Ceb&uacute;. At present they are comprehended in the bishopric
of Santa Isabel de Jaro, which was created by apostolic bull dated May twenty-seven, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five.
That bull was issued by his Holiness Pius IX; it dismembered several provinces of the archipelago from the bishopric of Ceb&uacute;,
and constituted the fourth bishopric of Filipinas, which is suffragan to the metropolitan of Manila.


</p>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e4710">
<h4>District of Romblon</h4>
<p>This district, which is composed of a group of islands, today forms one politico-military commandancy, which includes the
villages of Romblon, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>Banton, Badajoz, Cajidiocan, Odiongan, Looc, and Magallanes. All those villages can be called the creation of the Recollects,
who, when they touched this territory, encountered a small number of Christians scattered through the mountains of what is
now the chief district. By exposing their lives (and also losing them when the honor of God, or the interest of the monarchy
of Espa&ntilde;a, demanded it), they have succeeded in establishing many important villages from the wild settlements that they received.

</p>
<p>The few Christians of those islands composed the annexed village or visita of the curacy of Ajuy in the island of Panay; and
as it was very troublesome for the cura charged with their spiritual nurture to visit them, because of the risk that he ran
in crossing over, and the strength of the currents, he maintained there a secular assistant who administered the sacraments.

</p>
<p>The priest Don Francisco Rodriguez, charged with the unquiet and uncomfortable life in that benefice, being worn out, discussed
with the father-provincial of the Recollects, Fray Jos&eacute; de la Anunciaci&oacute;n, a satisfactory exchange. He also renounced his
right to the proprietary curacy, whereupon the bishop of Ceb&uacute;, Don Pedro de Arce, with the consent of this superior government,
gave us the spiritual administration of Romblon, Sibuyan, Usigan (or the island of Tablas), Simara, Banton, and Sibali<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4721src" href="#xd0e4721">2</a> (which is called Maestro de Campo by the Spaniards). The province of San Nicol&aacute;s received those places, for they considered
them as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>entrance into the Visayas Islands, and a good stepping-stone for their religious to go to the lands of Ceb&uacute; and Caraga. Consequently,
the Recollects began to increase and organize what had until then been useless, in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-five.

</p>
<p>[The villages and missions in the Recollects&#8217; charge are the following: Romblon, with 1,341 tributes, and 5,858 souls; Badajoz,
with 711 tributes, and 3,356 souls; Banton, with 1,181&frac12; tributes, and 4,717 souls; Cajidiocan, with 1,304 tributes, and 7,132
souls; Odiongan, with 5,705 souls; Looc, with 5,449 souls; and Magallanes, with 283&frac12; tributes, and 859 souls.]

<h4>Island and province of Negros</h4>
<p>This island, located to the south of Manila, is bounded on the north by the Visayan Sea, on the south by the sea which separates
it from Mindanao, on the east by the channel which separates it from Ceb&uacute;, and on the west by the sea that separates it from
Paragua. It is one hundred and twelve leguas from Manila; its length north and south is forty leguas, and its breadth from
east to west eleven.

</p>
<p>The centuries of the conquest tell us that already was the religious habit of the discalced Augustinians known in this most
fertile province; for in the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-two, brother Fray Francisco de San Nicol&aacute;s, a native
of C&aacute;diz, made a voyage from Negros to Manila. During that voyage he suffered terrible storms, escaping as by a miracle. That
voyage was on business for the service of the church, which proves that, in its beginnings, the Recollects had sown the seeds
of the gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>in that territory. In the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-two, father Fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio founded the convent
which was called Binalgaban, and which exercised spiritual care over one thousand five hundred families. The said mission
passed to the Society of Jesus. The divine Goodness wrought some wonderful events for the conversion of this island of Negros.
[One of these is mentioned.]

</p>
<p>But that germ was to produce its abundant and wonderful fruits in the nineteenth century. The observation of the prodigious
improvements which four religious who entered this island with the rich treasure of religion, to promote the spiritual and
material welfare of their fellows, have been able to produce, was reserved, in the designs of Providence, for our epoch. By
the force of their preaching the Catholic worship is receiving an increase of a hundredfold; the villages are dividing, and
the parishes are multiplying; the population is assuming a new character of culture and civilization; those Indians are becoming
affable, industrious, and enterprising; and they are very rapidly attaining the moral and material recompenses due to their
labor.

</p>
<p>His Excellency, the most illustrious Don Fray Romualdo Jimeno, bishop of Ceb&uacute;, under date of April fifteen, one thousand eight
hundred and forty-eight, represented to the superior government the scarcity of native priests for supplying the curacies
in this province, petitioning at the same time that the spiritual administration of the said province be entrusted to one
of the excellent orders in Filipinas. The governor and captain-general, Don Narciso Claver&iacute;a, conde de Manila, assented to
the proposition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>of the diocesan, and entrusted the island of Negros to the province of the Recollect fathers, by his decree of June twenty,
one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight. The very reverend father-provincial, Fray Joaquin Soriano, received such an arrangement
with due thanks; and immediately sent the vice-patron his nominations for the curacies of Siaton, Cabancalan, and Amblan&#8212;of
which those chosen assumed possession in the following year, one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine.

</p>
<p>From that date the population has increased greatly. The barrios have risen to be settled villages, and what were visitas
have become canonically-erected parishes. Agriculture has received a rapid and enormous impetus; and the uncultivated lands,
which were full of brambles, have been transformed into productive fields. That most fertile soil yields the rich products
of sugar, abac&aacute;, and coffee, and that with an abundance unknown in other regions of this archipelago. Churches have been built,
and convents for the decent housing of the Spanish priest and the holy functions of our order. Roads have been built, which
have made communication easy. Solid bridges of great beauty have been constructed; the waters of the rivers have been taken
to fertilize the fields; and in the neighborhood of the rivers a number of hydraulic machines and steam engines have been
set up, the natural sciences being called in to adapt their most powerful aid to the work. The natives of this island, instructed
and continually stimulated by their parish priests, have proved by experience the value of agriculture, when it is favored
by nature and when they co&ouml;perate with their labor; and what labor can do when aided with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>intelligence that does not become weakened before troubles, but is directed with untiring constancy and endurance.

</p>
<p>[The villages and missions of this province in charge of the Recollects are as follows: Cagayan, with 1,251&frac12; tributes, and
4,521 souls; Siaton, with 1,806 tributes, and 8,512 souls; Zamboanguita, with 1,060 tributes, and 4,0150 souls; Dauin, with
1,261&frac12; tributes, and 5,855 souls; Bacong, with 1,816&frac12; tributes, and 8,020 souls; Nueva-Valencia, with 1,400&frac12; tributes, and

were established in 1868, while that of Tolon had been established in 1855. In the twenty-eight villages above mentioned,
there are about forty Recollect missionaries, who are in charge of two hundred thousand souls. The fertility of the island
of Negros and the opening up of the country in modern times have caused a great increase in population from the near-by provinces
of Ceb&uacute;, Bohol, Iloilo, Antique, and C&aacute;piz. Agriculture has been greatly advanced and other improvements brought in by the
Recollects.]

<h4>Province of Calamianes</h4>
<p>These islands, located to the south of Manila, form in their multitude an archipelago. Many of them of small extent, are inhabited;
others are the temporary habitation of the natives, who go thither to sow their fields, because those lands are suitable for
farming; and others form a civil village and are religiously organized. The northern boundary of this archipelago is the Chinese
Sea; the eastern, that of Visayas; the southern, the island of Paragua, which is included in this province; and the western,
the Chinese Sea. The capital is about one hundred leguas from Manila. It has a military government and an alcalde-mayor for
its judicial business. As regards religion, all the parishes existing in Calamianes belonged to the bishopric of Ceb&uacute; from
the time of their reduction until the bishopric of Jaro was erected, when all these parishes passed to its jurisdiction.

</p>
<p>In the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-two, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>the numbers of the discalced Augustinians were increased by the second and third missions who had come from Espa&ntilde;a, and by
certain men who had taken the habit in the convent of Manila. Consequently, they were prepared to undertake new enterprises
for the increase of the faith, and to go to points distant from the metropolis in order to spread the knowledge of the Christian
name to those people who were living in heathendom.

</p>
<p>[The early details of this mission have been fully given in previous volumes. The villages and missions of this province (a
number of which are islands) in charge of the Recollects are as follows: Cuyo, with 2,392 tributes, and 9,475 souls; Agutaya,
with 519&frac12; tributes, and 2,258 souls; Paragua, with 618&frac12; tributes, and 3,219 souls; Dumaran, with 785 tributes, and 1,416 souls;
Puerto-Princesa, with 573 souls; Culion or Calamian, with 871&frac12; tributes, and 2,438 souls; and Balabac, with 581 souls. The
Recollect martyrs of the province of Calamianes are as follows: Francisco de Jesus Mar&iacute;a; Juan de San Nicol&aacute;s, 1638; Alonso
de San Agustin; Francisco de Santa M&oacute;nica, 1638; Juan de San Antonio; Martin de la Ascension; Antonio de San Agustin, 1658;
Manuel de Jesus y Mar&iacute;a, 1720; Antonio de Santa Ana, 1736. The fathers of this province held in captivity were Onofre de la
Madre de Dios, Juan de San Jos&eacute;, Francisco de San Juan Bautista, and Pedro Gibert de Santa Eulalia.]

<h4>Province of Ceb&uacute;</h4>
<p>[The Recollects land at Ceb&uacute; on their first arrival from Spain, and are later conceded a chapel by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>Bishop Pedro de Arce near the city, where they found a convent. We translate:]

</p>
<p>... In later times, the edifice has been improved and modified; the most notable of these changes was that of a few years
ago, which has made the convent larger and more beautiful, thus making it possible for it to attain its object&#8212;namely, the
entertainment of the religious who go to Visayas, and of the sick, who are compelled to go to Ceb&uacute; to be cured of their ailments.
The church is also very large, and suitable for the celebration of religious functions with the solemnity and splendor of
the Catholic worship. The faithful of Ceb&uacute; and of the immediate village of San Nicol&aacute;s attend that church, in order to fulfil
the Christian precepts and receive the sacraments. As there are always religious instructed in the Visayan language, many
devout persons daily frequent the church of the Recollects....

</p>
<p>In the beginning of its foundation, this convent had in charge the spiritual administration of the souls in the island of
Maripipi, by concession of the above-mentioned bishop; but later, through the force of various circumstances that occurred,
the natives of the said island went to the curacy of Bantayan, and the convent remained free and without any obligation so
far as they were concerned. At present the religious of the community labor as far as possible in the welfare of the souls
of those near by, moved only by reasons of charity, and by the greater glory of God, which they seek in its entirety.

<p>[The Recollect villages in this province are as follows: Danao, with 2,797&frac12; tributes, and 13,012 souls; Mandaue, with 2,408
tributes, and 11,034 souls; Liloan, with 1,385&frac12; tributes, and 6,962 souls; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>Consolaci&oacute;n, with 982&frac12; tributes, and 4,277 souls; Compostela, with 3,830 tributes, and 4,856 souls; Catmon, with 965&frac12; tributes,

<h4>Island of Bohol</h4>
<p>Situated in the center of the Visayas Islands, and bordered on its eastern part by the island of Leyte, having the great island
of Mindanao on its southern side, and being very near the island of Ceb&uacute; on the north, Bohol formed an integral part of the
territory of that province until the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, when a royal order dated July twenty-two
was received in which the creation of the new province of Bohol was decreed.

</p>
<p>The true beliefs of our holy order were received in that territory from the first time of the preaching of the gospel in this
archipelago. The people of Bohol believed in the God of the Christians as quickly as He was announced to them, and became
docile sons of the Catholic church without opposing that obstinate resistance to the good news which was experienced in the
other islands, and which cost the life of one of its first apostles. If they remained in their first heathendom, it had not
come to take the gross forms of a corrupted idolatry, applying the great idea of the divinity to despicable objects. Free
of this inconvenience, when the majesty and grandeur of our God was manifest to them, they revered His adorable perfections.
Even though there were perverse inclinations in the hearts of those natives, they were not given to polygamy; and when the
holy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>law of God was explained to them, and the respect that the sanctity of marriage (which was elevated by Jesus Christ to the
dignity of a sacrament) merits among Christians, they received these doctrines without any repugnance, since they were already
free from the great obstacles which perversity and corruption, elevated to their highest power&#8212;namely, to have polytheism
and idolatry as their foundation and support&#8212;can present against those doctrines. In the year one thousand five hundred and
ninety-five, the Jesuit fathers, Torres and Sanchez,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4789src" href="#xd0e4789">3</a> came to this island, and very soon established the Catholic religion in Baclayon. Later, they founded a church and convent
in Loboc; and then went to a site called Talibon, and overran the rest of the island, where they were able to conquer the
difficulties which presented themselves in the way of submitting to their rule&#8212;born rather of repugnance to the Spaniards
than of systematic opposition to the Christian faith. When Legaspi passed by Bohol and anchored at Jagna<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4798src" href="#xd0e4798">4</a> in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-four, he already had occasion to observe that same thing; and the explanation
given him by a Moro from Borneo whom he had found there trading, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>was, that two years before eight vessels from the Molucas had committed great outrages, and those pirates had said that they
were Castilians; and since they were of the same color and bore the same arms [as the Spaniards], the people of Bohol imagined
that the Spaniards would do the same thing to them as the men of the eight Portuguese boats had done.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4803src" href="#xd0e4803">5</a> When Christianity had acquired a great increase in that island, hell, angered by those spiritual improvements, availed itself
of the instrumentality of certain Moros of Mindanao, in order, if possible, to choke the seed of the gospel. Knowing that
the best means of attaining that object was to make them rebel against the Spaniards, who had brought to them the happiness
of their souls, hell stirred up a rebellion which had the same causes, and was invested with the same forms as the insurrection
of Caraga, and was of more lasting effect. The missionaries having absented themselves in order to celebrate in Ceb&uacute; the beatification
of St. Francis Javier, which was celebrated in the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-one, two or three criminals who
were wandering through the mountains seduced the tribes, as the messengers of the <i>diguata</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, divinity], to refuse obedience to the Spaniards, to abandon their settlements, and to unite together on the heights in groups,
to make themselves feared. Of six villages formed by the Jesuit fathers, only two remained faithful<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4815src" href="#xd0e4815">6</a> to the king of Espa&ntilde;a; while the rest took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>arms against the constituted authorities, and formed bands which displayed a hostile attitude in the hills and high places&#8212;so
that it was necessary to employ force and violent measures, in order to make them return to the fulfilment of their duty.
Exemplary punishments were inflicted, which procured a partial result. But that subversive idea was one of fatal consequences,
and produced some pernicious fruits so lasting that they have come down almost to our own days.


</p>

<div class="div3" id="xd0e4823">
<h4>Entrance of the Recollect fathers into the island of Bohol</h4>
<p>If in the seventeenth century a rebel voice&#8212;which emancipated from their obedience and respect to the authorities many unthinking
persons, who adhered to the sedition&#8212;sounded in the mountains of Bohol, in the eighteenth century that voice, instead of having
been completely extinguished, had continued to increase. We have admitted the valiant character of those natives, and granted
their natural aptitude in the use of weapons; concurrent with these were various other causes which aroused and increased
their disaffection, which had been extended to a very considerable number. Captained by intrepid leaders&#8212;as for example, Dagahoy,
Ignacio Ara&ntilde;ez, Pedro Bagio, and Bernardo Sanote&#8212;they had formed a body of insurgents in the mountains of Inabangan and Talibon.
That gave the superior government plenty to think about, because of the many years that the insurrection was in existence;
and because it always continued to increase until Fathers Lamberti (the missionary of Jagna) and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>Morales<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4830src" href="#xd0e4830">7</a> (of Inabangan) were sacrificed by them, a little after the middle of the past century. In such condition, then, was public
order in the province of Bohol; and the Spanish name enjoyed so little respect in that restless and disorganized island when,
inasmuch as the Jesuit fathers had left all the Spanish dominions, their administration was adjudged to us, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight. Father Pedro de Santa B&aacute;rbara was assigned as cura of Baclayon, and other Recollect
religious to the villages of Loon, Maribohoc, Tagbilaran, Dauis, Jagna, Dimiao, Loboc, and Inabangan, which are the eight
missions existing in that island in the above-mentioned epoch. A most difficult undertaking was offered to the zeal and loyalty
of the first Recollects who entered Bohol. A great prudence united with the greatest zeal, great valor with a knowledge of
all the difficulties, and a foresight of all the results, were necessary to rise superior to that so difficult situation,
and to fulfil their social and religious trust in so delicate circumstances, as was advisable to the service of religion and
the greater dignity of our country. When the father vicar-provincial of our new ministries, who was then the cura of Baclayon&#8212;a
religious of great energy, of proved zeal, and of not common daring&#8212;found himself in peaceful possession of the spiritual
administration of all the reduced villages, he thought seriously of probing to the bottom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>the beginning and progress of the rebellion, its actual condition, and the disposition of their minds. He established correspondence
with the leaders, held several conferences with them, acquired their utmost confidence, and succeeded in obtaining the submission
of Dagahoy; and the other leader, Bernardo Sanote, also returned to the service of God and of his Majesty. The Recollects
proceeded with so fine tact to make themselves masters of the wills of those untamable mountaineers, that, in a short time
after their arrival, they no longer needed an armed force for the security of their persons&#8212;although until then pickets of
soldiers were maintained in nearly all the villages for the defense of the ministers. Consequently, the soldiers were able
to retire from Loay, Maribohoc, and Loon, but always remained in Inabangan, Jagna, and Tagbilaran&#8212;not for the purpose of protecting
the ministering fathers, but to prevent all devastation and disorder on the part of those who were not subdued. A general
amnesty was granted to all the delinquents who had taken to the mountains. That produced many submissions, although it did
not wholly extinguish an evil whose roots were so old, and which responded to so many causes as had contributed to its growth.
Its final consequences lasted until the beginning of the present century; and when it was believed necessary to obtain the
complete tranquillity of the island and the entire extinction of the rebels, an expedition was formed in the time of General
Ricafort, composed of one thousand one hundred men&#8212;who were enrolled in Ceb&uacute;, and were embarked to fulfil their destiny on
May eight, in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven. The governor of Ceb&uacute;, Don Jos&eacute; L&aacute;zaro Cairo, commanded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>those forces. He was accompanied by the ex-father-provincial, Fray Miguel de Jesus, parish priest of Danao; and by father
Fray Julian Bermejo, ex-provincial of the calced Augustinians, parish priest of Boljoon. The outcome of the expedition was
all that could be desired; insubordination ceased to exist in the interior of Bohol, and the last remnants of the emancipated
came to an end in all parts of the island. The fruits of peace began to appear; and from that time all the inhabitants, at
the same time while they acquired the habits of obedience and respect, began to experience a new era of prosperity, and the
satisfaction consequent on the social life. From that time the population has greatly increased; and all the inhabitants remain
faithful to their duties, very respectful to all authority, and faithful vassals to the king of Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>For more than one century all this island has been under the spiritual direction of our province. During that time the number
of the Catholics has increased in so prodigious a manner that it has been raised to a number almost triple what it was when
we received it. At that time it was an integral part of the province of Ceb&uacute;. At present it forms a province by itself, and
is one of the most populous of the archipelago; and its people are closely settled and compact, active and industrious, diligent
and laborious.

</p>
<p>We received eight missions in this province, which were the eight regularly organized villages which then existed. Their spiritual
direction occasioned great sorrows to the ministers of that time, some of these even succumbing as victims to the insolence
and obstinacy of their own children. Today we count <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>one hundred and ten years of our existence in that district, and we cannot write of those natives a single page like those
of their old history, which was full of disagreeable, and some horrible, relations&#8212;whether because the Recollects had an understanding
of the peculiar dispositions of those Indians, and the means suitable to gain their respect and obedience; or whether, perchance,
one might say that the people of Bohol have had sufficient penetration to observe in their conduct certain manners so considerate
and so full of demonstrations of benevolence, which sentiments of compassion and interest in the adversities and lack of resources
of their parishioners, would cause in the minds of their new parish priests. Whichever of these may be accepted to explain
the long period of our stay in Bohol, exempt from all trouble, and the steady increase in our enjoyment of the consideration
and confidence of our proteg&eacute;s, we shall always make known the facts&#8212;very surprising and very gratifying to our corporation&#8212;that
were already begun to be observed from the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight, when the first Recollects went
to that island. They were received without any opposition, obeyed without repugnance, and were loved and respected; and these
mutual relations have continued without any lapse until the present time.

<h4>The province of Bohol at the present time</h4>
<p>After having mentioned in rapid survey the villages of which this province is at present composed, which are otherwise so
many quiet groups of honest and industrious natives&#8212;who form, in the religious estate, the same number of parishes canonically
established, each one with its own pastor, who is charged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>to watch over them through the functions of religion, and to dispense the sacraments and other benefits of religion to the
souls of his respective parish&#8212;and having enumerated the communities that make up the general total of the population of what
is now one of the most populous provinces of the archipelago: a meditative mind goes back about one century with the desire
of ascertaining the state of the province in that time, since now we are seeing its condition in our own time. It has been
stated above, in the introduction, that the villages having regular ministers were eight in number. In regard to canonical
legislation then in force, those ministers had the character of missionaries, and not of parish priests. They labored in the
salvation of souls with the apostolic zeal generally recognized (and denied by no one), which is characteristic of the fathers
of the Society of Jesus. But the social state of those natives was a hindrance to the abundant fruit that ought to be expected
from the fervent devotion and charity of so distinguished missionaries.

</p>
<p>The insurrections which took place in Bohol in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had succeeded in forming a considerable
body of malcontents who raised the banner of rebellion and disorder; and the disorder at the same time when it destroyed the
obedience of most of their subjects to the authorities, also influenced very directly the advancement of Catholicism, and
gave as a result that all those who took to the mountains, thus being separated from the immediate neighborhood of the eight
churches then existing, returned to the habits of heathenism at the same time when they passed to the camp of freedom. Other
things also were added <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>to the causes which diminished the abundant fruits of the priestly ministry. That coldness of the people of Bohol toward the
Spanish name, observed long before by Legaspi at the time of the discovery, and certain opposition inspired by some captious
natives who favored but little the very zealous ministers of Jesus Christ (who were sacrificing their own existence for the
eternal salvation of those souls), placed this territory in an abnormal condition, taking from it the forces necessary for
its advancement and prosperity. Above all, peacefulness had left those shores, a loss which made it impossible to give signs
of life and social and religious increase. One hundred and ten years have elapsed since the discalced Augustinians first entered
Bohol. They did not go there as conquistadors; they did not go to preach the name of Christ to heathenism and idolatry; they
did not go to make new vassals for the king of Espa&ntilde;a of a people who had not sworn their obedience. The mission of the Recollect
fathers to the island of Bohol was to continue the tasks of the Jesuit fathers; to preach the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ,
just as the Jesuits did; and to present themselves to the observation of those natives in their apostolic and religious bearing,
as worthy imitators of so zealous priests. They also had the thorny task of inculcating habits of gratitude and obedience
in discontented minds; and of reducing a considerable number of rebels to the payment of the royal tribute, who had already
begun a struggle, with some pretensions to triumph. The hope of religion and society in the discalced Augustinians, in the
difficult circumstances through which the island of Bohol was passing when they took charge of its administration, was that
peace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>would be extended to the remotest corners of its territory, so that the religious beginnings would have an efficacious influence
on the misguided multitude, and Spanish authority would completely dominate men and things which had been separated from its
beneficent influence. Facts are demonstrating with the greatest clearness that the Recollects attained abundantly the end
of all their aspirations. At present we are experiencing that the reality exceeds the hopes that could animate them when they
entered on their task. The universal harmony that this province enjoys in the present century, and the state of prosperity
in which all the natives live, as well as the growth of population, and the increase of culture, religious fervor, and instruction
that they enjoy&#8212;all this speaks very loudly in favor of the preaching of the Recollects in Bohol. These considerations also
demonstrate with the greatest clearness that, even if the Recollects were not its conquistadors, they are without dispute
the instruments employed by Providence for its political and religious advancement; and that they are with all propriety the
pacifiers and restorers of the beginnings of Christian society in that island, which was in confusion until that time. As
soon as they entered, a relation of sympathy was established between them and their proteg&eacute;s, as hidden as it was intimate,
by virtue of which they were enabled to direct all their individual forces to the attempt at perfection and the improvements
that they had planned. As they always directed these successfully, and were always obeyed with promptness, they were enabled
to realize the material and intellectual transformation of that district newly entrusted to their care. There are at present
thirty-three parishes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>in this province, according to the preceding relation. In each one of them has been erected a Catholic temple, sufficient
in itself alone to give glory to the hand that has directed it. In all of those parishes there is a parish house&#8212;more or less
elegant, but always sufficiently solid and suitable&#8212;which is teaching to the present generation (and the future one also)
the fatigues that the Recollect must have endured who placed the first stone and finished the work, in each of those parishes
(which are a like number of villages), public halls have been constructed under the direction of the parish priests. In all
of them schools for both sexes have been erected, where religious instruction is given to them. Since this exercises its proper
influence on the minds of the youth, it has succeeded in forming the present generation&#8212;who are established in all the beliefs
of our true religion, exactly observant of the practices which it imposes upon them, thankful and respectful to the ministers
of Jesus Christ, and very diligent in the fulfilment of their social duties, all those who pay tribute to his Majesty being
comprehended in this obligation.

</p>
<p>The number of those who paid tribute in this island could not have been very large in the eight missions that existed when
the island came into our possession, when one considers the state of insubordination in which that multitude were living,
most of whom were separated from organized society and in revolt in the interior of the territory. In proportion as it continued
to assume its normal state, and commenced to enjoy the peace that it has at the present time, its population continued to
increase, and in the year one thousand eight hundred and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>thirty-eight was more than one hundred thousand souls; in one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two, the total of its population
was increased to one hundred and fifty thousand; at present the island of Bohol, which is a province, has a population of
two hundred and sixty thousand souls.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4869src" href="#xd0e4869">8</a>

</p>
<p>This prodigious increase of inhabitants in an area so small, and amid conditions so little advantageous for agriculture, has
no other explanation than the conscientious and constant labor of the regular parish priests, each of whom notes in his respective
parish register with scrupulous niceness the heights and depths of his district, without any of the alterations that can modify
the statistics of his village escaping his eye; and who assigns to their respective dwellings men and women, and youths and
old people, with the correct date of their birth. From this patriotic labor it results that the obligations of the royal treasury
are satisfied by all the people of Bohol at the moment when they become of proper age.

</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the advantageous conditions by which the character of those peoples has been modified, and how they have been
completely withdrawn from those untamable and savage forms of life which lasted until the last century, and that they have
at present become fond of work, respectful to authority, and grateful in their social intercourse, we can infer that the ministers
of the order who are at present watching over the necessities of their souls are laboring tirelessly in the confessional,
are preaching the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>word of God without cessation, and are consoling the sick in their most remote dwellings. In the midst of so many lofty occupations
of the religious ministry, the Recollects have been able to study even the physical necessities of their proteg&eacute;s, and the
ingenious manner of making these lighter. To their direction is owing the different industries proceeding from the products
of the earth, which, prepared and elaborated with due intelligence, furnish other kinds of business, permitted and honorable,
which afford abundant means for the life and support of those natives. If agriculture does not furnish most abundant products,
because of the nature of the soil in Bohol, those natives do not for that reason sleep in inactivity; they go to seek their
living where they can find it. They do not abhor work, which is the true fount of all means of subsistence. They undertake
voyages by land and sea, with the praiseworthy purpose of making their living by virtue of their fatigues and labors. This
is the exact description of the inhabitants of Bohol; and this is what has been obtained from those people (from whom religion
and the country expected so little) by the province of San Nicol&aacute;s de Tolentino, by means of the worthy children of its bosom
whom it sent to that land, and through those who have continued, furthered, and perfected the arduous attempt at the culture
and civilization of those natives....

<h3 class="normal">The Recollects of Mindanao</h3>
<p>[The entrance of the Recollects into Mindanao, and the earlier years of their preaching there, have been already given in
preceding volumes of this series.]

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e4887">
<h4>Division of parishes in Mindanao</h4>
<p>Although it is clear that the fathers of the Society of Jesus entered this land in the year one thousand five hundred and
ninety-six to procure its spiritual conquest, by permission of the cabildo governing the vacant see of Manila, and that the
call of the gospel resounded in the site Tampacan [misprinted Jampacan], when our soldiers retired the fathers of the Society
had to do the same. In the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine, the Observantine Augustinians took this vineyard
in their charge, and father Fray Francisco Xaraba<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4892src" href="#xd0e4892">9</a> went to cultivate it with a companion; but undeceived, [and seeing] that only war could open the way for their preaching,
because of the exceeding ferocity of the people, they abandoned the undertaking and returned to Ceb&uacute;. The missionaries of
the Society returned [to Mindanao], and preached on the river of Butuan; and those who were then converted by them formed
a visita of a village in Bohol.

</p>
<p>After the deed of arms above mentioned, the Recollect missionaries, with the necessary permits from the bishop and the royal
vice-patron, founded the first convent and village of Tandag, and then the convent and village of Jigaquit; a third village
and convent on the river of Butuan, whence they continued their conquests and went up the river of Butuan to the interior
of the island, to a lake called Linao; and the fourth village and convent, fifty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>leguas from Butuan. Then they went to Cagayan,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e4899src" href="#xd0e4899">10</a> where they also founded a church and convent; whence they crossed to the island of Camiguin, where they did the same; and
lastly in the island of Surigao and Bislig. Eight settlements, perfectly organized in the social order, with churches suitable
for the public worship of our true religion, with convenient buildings for the habitation of their ministers&#8212;where they could
practice the exercises of the monastic life, and whence issued the splendors of their edifying holiness to illumine the dark
shades of idolatry and paganism, served as the original basis for the spread of the faith. After that, they continued to found
many other villages dependent on the first, which were then considered as visitas or subject villages. Some of those villages
came in later times to be the residences of our Recollect ministers, according to the available number of religious that the
corporation possessed, or according as the necessities or growth of population in the said subject villages demanded.

</p>
<p>Our predecessors also succeeded in getting to the lake of Malanao, and the village of Iligan, and Bayug. As there were certain
questions regarding the spiritual jurisdiction, his Majesty defined them, marking out the limits of religious zeal between
the two families (who were equally inflamed with the desire for the salvation of souls), by drawing a line <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>from the point of Suloguan to the cape of San Agustin, and assigning the administration on its western side to the most religious
fathers of the Society of Jesus, while our peaceful possession was marked on the eastern side. Lastly, when the reverend Jesuit
fathers left the islands, the administration of Zamboanga was adjudged to us in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight,
as well as the villages of Lubungan, Dapitan, and Misamis (and consequently their barrios&#8212;some of which, as time went on,
came to be villages).


</p>
</div>
<div class="div3" id="xd0e4906">
<h4>Present administration of the Recollects</h4>
<p>Her Majesty Do&ntilde;a Isabel II decreed the establishment of the house of Loyola on October nineteen, one thousand eight hundred
and fifty-two, with permission to go to the missions of Mindanao and Jol&oacute;. September ten, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one,
another royal order was issued, declaring that the missionaries of the Society of Jesus have exclusive rights in the planting
and successive development of the effective missions in Mindanao; and that the same were to take charge of the administration
of the curacies and missions already reduced by the Recollect Augustinian religious as fast as these were vacated by the death
or transfer of those who serve them with canonical collation or under title of temporary incumbent. Her Majesty, desiring
at the same time to concede an indemnification, and to give proof of the appreciation with which she views the services bestowed
on the Church and on the state by the above-mentioned Augustinian religious, has been pleased to grant to the province of
San Nicol&aacute;s de Tolentino the administration of the curacies of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>province of Cavite or of the diocese of Manila which are served by the native clergy.

</p>
<p>May nineteen, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, another royal order was issued, dictating instructions for the compensation
of curacies accorded to the province of San Nicol&aacute;s de Tolentino in return for those in Mindanao which they were to surrender
to the Jesuit missionaries. In that order it was decided that in every certified instance of a vacancy in Mindanao, and its
surrender to and occupation by the Jesuit fathers, indemnification therefor was to be made to the Recollect fathers, in Cavite
and the diocese of Manila, with the curacy which might be vacant at that time, even if it were in charge of a temporary incumbent;
and if there were more than one curacy vacant, then the wishes of the vice-patron were to be followed, after first hearing
the very reverend archbishop, the provincial of the order, and the council of administration. Should there not be any curacy
vacant, then [indemnification was to be made] with the first which should become vacant. As obedient subjects to the orders
of her Majesty, from that date we relinquished, in the same order in which they fell vacant, the ministries that we held in
Mindanao; and we handed over Zamboanga, Tetuan, Lubungan, Dapitan, Butuan, Surigao, Jigaquit, Davao, Bislig, Cattabato, Mainit,
Dinagat, Balingasag, Alubijid. In exchange we received the curacies in the district of Morong&#8212;namely, Antipolo and Taytay;
the village of La Hermita, in the province of Manila; Calauan, in Laguna; Cavite port, and Rosario, in the province of Cavite;
Boac, in the island of Marinduque; and the villages of Rosario, Santo Tom&aacute;s, Balayan, and Lobo, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>province of Batangas. The sacrifice made by the Recollect corporation by ceding parishes created by it and watered with the
sweat and blood of its most eminent members, nourished by the doctrine of apostolic men to be revered by us, and very worthy
of our imitation, is equal to the respect with which the Recollects have always received the orders of their august monarchs,
and to the obedience and adhesion with which they have always served in this archipelago as Catholic priests, and in the shade
of our Spanish banner.

</p>
<p>[The Recollect villages still in Mindanao are as follows: Tandag, with 1,783&frac12; tributes, and 3,957 souls; Cantilan, with 189&frac12;
tributes, and 7,366 souls; Cabuntog, with 990 tributes, and 3,731 souls; Numancia, with 862&frac12; tributes, and 3,366 souls; Cagayan,
with 2,585&frac12; tributes, and 11,499 souls; Jasaan, with 1,2821&frac12; tributes, and 5,878 souls; Iponan, with 1,078&frac12; tributes, and
5,570 souls; Alubijid, with 1,210 tributes, and 4,989 souls; Iligan, with 1,098 tributes, and 4,577 souls; Misamis, with 1,561&frac12;
tributes, and 6,419 souls; Jimenez, with 2,178&frac12; tributes, and 8,616 souls; Catarman, with 1,202 tributes, and 5,105 souls;
Sagay, with 1,218 tributes, and 5,482 souls; Mambajao, with 1,684 tributes, and 5,246 souls; and Mahinog, with 1,037 tributes,
and 4,382 souls. In the time of La Concepci&oacute;n (<i>ca.</i> 1750), the Recollects had charge of thirty-six villages in Mindanao and dependent islands; in 1852, they had charge of eighteen,
and were showing rapid increase when they were ordered to transfer them to the Jesuits. The martyrs and captives of the Recollects
in Mindanao are as follows: Juan de la Madre de Dios, killed 1723; Brother Juan de San Nicol&aacute;s, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>martyred; Jacinto de Jesus y Maria, martyred; Alonso de San Jos&eacute;, killed 1631; Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s, killed 1631; Pedro de
San Antonio, killed July 21, 1631; Agust&iacute;n de Santa Mar&iacute;a, killed May 16, 1651; Lorenzo de San Facundo, captured 1635; Hip&oacute;lito
de San Agustin, captured May 20, 1740; Antonio del Santo Cristo, captured 1754; Est&eacute;ban de San Jos&eacute;, killed by Moros, March
28, 1764; Jos&eacute; de Santa Teresa, killed in combat with Moros in 1770; and Jos&eacute; de la Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad, captured 1774.]

<h4>Marianas Islands</h4>
<p>[These islands were in charge of the Jesuits, but after the expulsion of the Society were given to the Recollects, who had
them in charge during 1768&#8211;1814, when they abandoned them because of their few laborers. The Recollects reassumed that field
in 1819, and in 1879 had there seven priests.]

<p>[The following account is obtained from <i lang="es">Archipi&eacute;lago filipino</i> (prepared by the Jesuit fathers at Manila; Washington, 1900), ii, pp. 258&#8211;267.]


</p>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e5581">
<h3 class="normal">The progressive increase of Catholics in Filipinas until 1898</h3>
<p>In order to understand the present condition of the Catholic religion in Filipinas (we refer to the year 1896, before the
Tag&aacute;l insurrection), it will be advisable to place before the eyes of the reader the growth of the Christian population and
the increase of the faithful from the coming of the Spaniards until the present time.

</p>
<p>The number of inhabitants whom the Spaniards encountered at their arrival in these islands is not known with exactness, but
it is calculated by some historians as below two millions; and it will not be imprudent to affirm that they all scarcely reached
one and one-half millions&#8212;whether idolaters, who admitted the plurality of gods; or Moros, who although they professed (as
they still profess) the unity of God, did not believe (as they still do not believe) the divinity of Jesus Christ, but who
have, on the contrary, been instructed from their earliest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>years by their parents and pandits to hate Christianity.

</p>
<p>The Spanish missionaries arrived, then, and began the work of evangelization at the same time as the humanitarian undertaking
to reduce them to a civilized life; for most of the Indians and Moros were living in scattered groups along the coasts, and
in the fields and thickets in small settlements.

</p>
<p>What was the result of their apostolic labors? Let us see. Father Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5594src" href="#xd0e5594">1</a> chronicler of the Franciscan missionaries, gives us the following data:


<i>General summary of souls, reckoning only the natives that were reduced to Christianity throughout the archipelago of Filipinas

</p>
<p>Father Delgado, who wrote in the year 1750, gives almost the same statistics, but adds the following:

</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not doubt that the souls that are ministered to, throughout the islands of this archipelago, by secular and regular
priests, exceed one million and many thousands in addition; for, in the lists made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>by the ministers, the children still below the age of seven years are neither entered nor enumerated. Accordingly, I shall
base my count on the enumeration made a few years ago.&#8221;

<p>He concludes by saying:

</p>
<p>&#8220;The resultant difference of the foregoing comparison, founded on public documents, shows an excess of fifty-two per cent
of increase in each eighteen years; and if a like proportion continues, the population of the Filipinas Islands will be doubled
in thirty-four years&#8212;an increase which could be judged incredible if we did not have an extraordinary example in Filadelfia
[<i>i.e.</i>, Philadelphia], <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>which has doubled its population in twenty-eight years, as Buffon, supported by the authority of Doctor Franklin, affirms.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The above assertion of Comyn has been realized now in all exactness, if we are to judge by the assertions, in his published
works, of Don Felipe de Pan, a studious newspaper man of Manila; for, according to that writer, the population of Filipinas
exceeded 9,000,000 in 1876.

</p>
<p>Ferreiro, secretary of the <span lang="es">Sociedad Geogr&aacute;fica de Madrid</span> [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Geographical Society of Madrid&#8221;], also calculated the population of Filipinas in 1887 at 9,000,000 approximately, a number
which seems to be somewhat above actual fact.

</p>
<p>In an investigation finished in the last quarter of 1894, the population of the archipelagoes which composed the general government
of Filipinas appears in the following form:

</p>
<p>To whom is due this increase of Catholicism, and this growth of the population of Filipinas in general, from the time of the
conquest by the Spaniards? It is due to the regular and secular clergy. One can scarcely ascribe any importance to the immigration
into Filipinas during the lapse of years. The Chinese, and the Europeans (including the Spaniards themselves), can be considered,
as a general rule, as birds of passage, who come to live here for a few years and then return to their own country. The Filipino
population has increased, thanks to the organization and good government at the centers [of population], which were established
chiefly by missionary action, at the time when the natives of the evangelized territories became Christians. The secular power,
even when aided by arms, has not even attempted to form villages of the heathen; neither have the military posts become well
populated or stable settlements. The center of attraction and of coherence in Filipino villages has always been, and is still,
the church and the convent. The parish priest (who is not a bird of passage) is, as a rule, the most respected authority,
the chief guarantee of order and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>peace, and the most careful guardian of morality&#8212;an indubitable and most important cause of increase in the population of
every country. The numerous and important settlements, which have now other powerful roots and elements of cohesion, began
and were formed thus. If the center of union of which we are speaking be removed from them, especially if they are recent
and young, one will see how families break up, and how the new citizens easily return to the life of the mountain.

<div class="div2" id="xd0e5869">
<h3 class="normal">Present state of the archbishopric of Manila, and of the bishoprics of Ceb&uacute;, Jaro, Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and Nueva Segovia</h3>
<p>In order to feed this flock of six and one-half millions of Catholics, the church of Filipinas relies on one archbishop and
four bishops.

</p>
<p>The present archbishop of Manila is Don Fray Bernardino Nozaleda, of the Order of St. Dominic, a wise and prudent prelate,
who took possession of his see October 29, 1890. This archdiocese has a magnificent cathedral, and possesses a considerable
cabildo, which was composed of twenty-four prebends in the time of Spanish domination. The ecclesiastical court has its offices
in the archiepiscopal palace. The conciliar seminary is a fine edifice, and is in charge of the fathers of the congregation
of St. Vincent de Paul;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5876src" href="#xd0e5876">2</a> but it is at present closed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>because of the condition of war prevailing in the country. The <i lang="es">obras pias</i> of the miter amounted before the revolution to a considerable fund, and are in charge of an administrator. The archbishopric
of Manila has 219 parishes, 24 mission parishes, 16 active missions, 259 parish priests or missionaries, and 198 native secular
priests for the aid of the parish priests.

</p>
<p>Don Fray Mart&iacute;n de Garc&iacute;a de Alcocer, of the Order of St. Francis, governs the diocese of Ceb&uacute;. He is a very worthy prelate,
and is greatly beloved by all his diocesans. He took possession of his diocese December 11, 1886. There is an old cathedral
in Ceb&uacute;, and another new one was erected when the revolution was begun. That city has, also, a conciliar seminary in charge
of the Paulist fathers, and two hospitals subordinate to the miter. The diocese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>numbers 166 parishes, 15 mission parishes, 32 active missions, 213 parish priests or missionaries, and 125 native clergy.

</p>
<p>By the death of Don Fray Leandro Arru&eacute;, which happened in 1897, Don Fray Mauricio Ferrero, an ex-provincial of the religious
of the Order of the Augustinian Recollects, has just been appointed bishop of Jaro. The bishopric of Jaro possesses a cathedral
church, which is also the parish church of the city of Jaro; and it has a court corresponding to it, and a seminary under
the management of the Paulist fathers. In the diocese there are 144 parishes, 23 mission parishes, 33 active missions, 200
parish priests or missionaries, and 73 native clergy employed in the parish ministry.

</p>
<p>The diocese of Nueva C&aacute;ceres has as Bishop Don Fray Arsenio del Campo, of the Order of St. Augustine, who took possession
of his see June 3, 1888. Although it, like the dioceses of Ceb&uacute;, Jaro, and Nueva Segovia, has no cabildo, nevertheless there
is a cathedral church in Nueva C&aacute;ceres, an ecclesiastical court, a conciliar seminary in charge of the Paulist fathers, and
a leper hospital. The bishopric of Nueva C&aacute;ceres has 107 parishes, 17 parish missions, 124 parish priests or missionaries,
and 148 native priests.

</p>
<p>The present bishop of Nueva Segovia is Don Fray Jos&eacute; Hevia Campomanes, a religious of the Order of St. Dominic&#8212;who is most
fluent in the Tag&aacute;l language, and had been, for many years before, parish priest of Binondo, which parish he enriched with
a fine cemetery. He took possession of his see June 19, 1890, but was made a prisoner at the outbreak of the revolution; and
he still lies, as these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>lines are penned, under the heavy chains of captivity, and not always treated as his holy character, his authority, and his
personal qualities merit.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5910src" href="#xd0e5910">3</a> The diocese of Nueva Segovia has 110 parishes, 26 parish missions, 35 active missions, 171 parish priests or missionaries,
and 131 native priests. The ecclesiastical court resides in Vigan, where there is also a cathedral church; and a conciliar
seminary which has been, until the present, directed by the religious of St. Augustine.

</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e5955">
<h3 class="normal">Religious spirit of the country</h3>
<p>After this statistical religious summary, we cannot resist our desire to explain, although briefly, what is at present and
definitively the character or qualities of the religious spirit reigning in this country&#8212;which owes everything that it is,
aside from the purely natural elements, to the Catholic civilization of Espa&ntilde;a. This point is, on another side, very pertinent
to the whole subject.

</p>
<p>It is not to be doubted, then, that the mass of the natives who have received the direct influence of Spanish civilization
are entirely Catholic. The heathen natives are yet barbarous or semi-barbarous; and the Moros, besides being without the civilization
of the Christian Indians, do not retain either, from the merely external Mahometanism, more than their innate pride and treachery,
and some few formalities, known and practiced by a very few of their race. Those in Filipinas who profess, or say that they
profess, any other positive religion (and more especially any other Christian religion), distinct from the Catholic, will
be found absolutely only among the foreign element. Therefore, Catholicism is the religion, not only of the majority, but
of all the civilized Filipinos.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is also certain that the Filipinos are sincere Catholics. Their religion suits them, and is congenial to their nature.
They practice it spontaneously, and profess it openly and publicly, without any objection. Far from all their minds is the
most remote suspicion that Catholicism is not the true and only religion capable of bringing about their temporal and eternal
happiness. All of these Indians are by nature docile to the teachings and admonitions of their parish priests and spiritual
fathers. Many good people approach the holy sacraments easily and frequently; and the fact that many others do not approach
or frequent them so often must be attributed to neglect, to heedlessness, or to real difficulties, but never to aversion.
The ceremonies and the solemnity of the worship attract them very powerfully, and so do the popular Catholic exhibitions of
great feasts and processions. They display without any objection, but rather with great pleasure, the pious objects and insignia
of any devotion or pious association to which they belong; and in many places the women wear the scapular or rosary around
the neck as a part or complement of their dress. It may be said that there is no house or family, however poor it be, that
does not have a domestic altar or oratory. There are some careless Christians among the Filipino people, vicious and scandalous
because of their evil habits; there are even some who are ignorant of the most necessary things of their religion: but there
are no unbelievers or impious ones among them&#8212;unless some few, relatively insignificant in number, who have become vitiated
and corrupted in foreign countries, and afterward have returned to their country. Even these latter have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>hitherto, because of a certain feeling of shame that they retain, taken care not to let that change be seen, except among
irreligious associates or those of another form of worship. Finally, the tertiary orders, brotherhoods, and pious and devotional
associations, old and new, have always had a great number of individuals enrolled in the Filipinas, and even constant and
fervent affiliated members.

</p>
<p>The Catholic religion, always holy and sanctifying, works in those who adopt it, according to the natural or acquired disposition
of the same. Thus it is that the defects of character in the Indians, if they are frequently moderated, thanks to the religion
that they profess, wholly disappear but with difficulty, and generally even have some influence on the private life and religious
character of the natives. Since they are, therefore, more superficial and more impressionable to new things than those of
other races, they would perhaps be less constant in their Catholic practices, sentiments, and convictions, and would feel
more easily than do others the evil influences of false doctrines and worships, if they had experience with these. They are
readily inclined to superstitions, now by their former bad habits, now by their nearness to and communication with those who
are yet heathen, now by their exceedingly puerile imagination, and by their nature, which is influenced by their surroundings.

</p>
<p>This we believe is, in broad lines, the religious character of the Indians of Filipinas. Let us now see what has been said
recently also in regard to this same point by another contemporaneous witness, with whom we almost entirely agree. Mr. Peyton,
a Protestant bishop, said, when speaking of Catholicism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>in the Filipinas, at a meeting of the Protestant bishops of the Episcopal church held at St. Louis (United States), in the
month of last October: &#8220;I found a magnificent church in every village. I was present at mass several times, and the churches
were always full of natives&#8212;even when circumstances were unfavorable, because of the military occupation. There are almost
no seats in those churches, while the services last&#8212;an hour, or an hour and a half. Never in my life have I observed more
evident signs of profound devotion than in those there present. The men were kneeling, or prostrated before the altar; and
the women were on their knees, or seated on the floor. No one went out of the church during the service, or talked to others.
There is no spirit of sectarianism there. All have been instructed in the creed, in the formal prayers, in the ten commandments,
and in the catechism. All have been baptized in infancy.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5973src" href="#xd0e5973">5</a> I do not know whether there exists in this country a village so pure, moral, and devout as is the Filipino village.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="xd0e5979">
<h3 class="normal">Granting the above, would freedom of worship be advisable for Filipinos?</h3>
<p>Since, then, the religion in Filipinas, and consequently their morals, is so unanimous, would it be advisable to introduce
freedom of worship into this country? If one understands by freedom of worship only actual religious toleration, by virtue
of which no one can be obliged to profess Catholicism, and no one be persecuted for neglecting to be a Catholic, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>or that each one profess privately the religion that he pleases, that freedom has always existed in Filipinas; and no Filipino
or foreigner was ever obliged to embrace the Catholic religion. But if one understands by freedom of worship the concession
to all religions (for example, to those of Confucius, Mahomet, and to all the Protestant sects) of equal rights to open schools,
erect churches, create parishes, and celebrate public processions and functions, as does the Catholic church, we believe that
not only is this not advisable, but that it would be a fatal measure to any government which rules the destinies of Filipinas.
If, in fact, this government should concede such freedom of worship, it would cause itself to be hated by the six and one-half
millions of Filipino Catholics; for, even though such government should profess no worship, the Filipino people would consider
it as responsible for all the consequences of such a measure; and therefore it would not be looked on favorably by these six
and one-half millions of Catholics. These people are fully convinced that theirs is the only true religion, and the only one
by which they can be saved. If any government should endeavor to despoil them of that religion&#8212;which is their most precious
jewel, and the richest inheritance which they have received from their ancestors&#8212;even should it be no more than permitting
the Protestant or heterodox propaganda publicly and openly, then they could not refrain from complaint; and from that might
even come the disturbance of public order, or perhaps some politico-religious war, accompanied by all the cruelty and all
the disasters which, as are well known, are generally brought on by such wars.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>Two serious difficulties can be opposed against the rights of Catholicism in Filipinas. The first is in the Americans who
are governing at present, and the second is in the Filipinos themselves. The Americans enjoy in America the most complete
freedom of worship; why, then, should they not enjoy that same freedom when they go to Filipinas? We answer, that every inhabitant
must conform to the laws of the country in which he lives. The Chinese enjoyed in China the most complete freedom to erect
temples to Buddha or to Confucius; but for three centuries they have not enjoyed a like freedom in Manila, although no Chinese
has been forced to become a Catholic. We go farther and say that no Chinese has had to boast of his religion in order to trade,
become rich, and return to China. The same can be said of the English and Americans. If it is necessary for the good order
and government of six and one-half millions of Catholics in Filipinas, besides those who are not Catholics (one and one-half
millions, counting idolaters and Moros yet to be civilized), not to permit or encourage freedom of worship, the government
which rules the destiny of these islands ought to legislate along those lines, since the laws ought to be adjusted to the
needs of the majority of their inhabitants. The Americans themselves who shall take up their residence here ought to accommodate
themselves to that law. No temporal or spiritual harm would result to them, for they could privately profess what their conscience
dictated to them as the true religion. Thus the English do in Malta, where the Catholic religion is in force; and although
the island is so small, there are two thousand Italian Catholic priests in it, who are more content to live <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>under the English government than under the Italian.

</p>
<p>The other difficulty against Catholicism in Filipinas springs from the Filipino insurgents themselves, who voted for freedom
of worship and separation from the Spanish church in their congress of Malolos.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e5993src" href="#xd0e5993">6</a> Why, then, has not that freedom of worship been granted to the Filipinos, if they themselves ask it? We reply that they also
ask for independence. Will the Americans grant them the latter because of that fact? The majority of the Filipino insurgent
chiefs were inclined to Masonry. They had bound themselves, for a long time past, to work for the expulsion of the friars;
and, drunk with the wine of liberty, they asked for every kind of freedom, including that of religion. How many insurgents
have abjured Catholicism? Their number does not exceed two dozen. The law of freedom of worship is unnecessary for them, since
they profess no religion. The Filipino people&#8212;that is to say, the six and one-half millions of Catholics enrolled in the parish
registers&#8212;do not ask or desire religious freedom, or separation from the Spanish church. They are content with their Catholicism,
and desire nothing else; and they will not suffer their government to take from them their Catholic unity. We have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>heard this from qualified and accredited defenders of Filipino independence. They even deny that the vote at Malolos was the
true expression of the will of that congress, which was also very far from being the entire and genuine representation of
the Filipino people. The latter hold heresies, and all manner of religious disturbance, in horror. He who would introduce
these into their homes would offer them an insult. Consequently, it is demonstrated that freedom of worship in Filipinas is
not advisable, but adverse to the public peace.

</p>
<p>If it is said finally, that there are some points of public interest which demand some reform, in what pertains to the religious
estate of the Filipinas, we shall not be the ones to deny that. But the Church has the desire and the means to remedy these
supposed or recognized evils. If, peradventure, it do not remedy them through ignorance, let anyone who is interested, and
the government of the country first of all, bring them to its notice. On the other hand, this matter has no connection with
religious freedom.

</p>
<p>[From the same work (pp. 256, 257) is taken the following mention of the religious orders who recently established themselves
in the Philippines:]

</p>
<p>In all the dioceses the bishops looked after the founding of seminaries for the native clergy, not only because such were
needed to aid in the administration of the sacraments in the large parishes created by the religious, but also for the occupation
of some parishes which were reserved for them from very ancient times.

<h3 class="normal">The fathers of the congregation of St. Vincent de Paul, the Capuchins, and the Benedictines, come to the islands</h3>
<p>For the direction of some of these seminaries, the sons of St. Vincent de Paul came from Espa&ntilde;a in 1862, together with the
brothers of charity, who took charge of the attendance of the sick in the hospitals, and of the teaching of young women.

</p>
<p>The Capuchin fathers also came to these islands in the year 1886, for the purpose of taking charge of the missions of both
Carolinas and Palaos, a duty which they have fulfilled marvelously, and not without the sacrifice of all human ambitions&#8212;burying
themselves forever in those solitudes of the Pacific ocean, for the love of the poor natives of the Carolinas.

<p>Finally, in 1895, the Benedictine fathers,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e6014src" href="#xd0e6014">7</a> of the monastery of Monserrat in Espa&ntilde;a, landed in Manila for the first time, in order to take charge of some missions on

in the Latin Quarter in Paris among the students&#8212;an organization known as &#8220;<span lang="fr">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de bonnes &eacute;tudes</span>&#8221; or &#8220;Society of good studies,&#8221; and which was designed primarily for the spiritual growth of its members. The immediate cause
that led to the formation of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul was the sneers of the non-Christians and freethinkers among
the students <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e5882" href="#xd0e5882">339n</a>]</span>who contended that the spirit of Christianity was dead. The objects striven for by the new society were greater spiritual
growth, and charitable work&#8212;the latter extending to work among the poor and imprisoned, and the teaching of children. In 1835
the society was divided into sections, in order that the work among the poor might be carried on better from many centers.
It grew rapidly, and received papal sanction in 1845. By 1853 the society had spread to England, America, Ireland, Spain,
Belgium, and Palestine. In 1861, being charged with political bickerings, they were persecuted by the French government, and
were ordered to accept Cardinal Morlot as the head of the general council which had been formed in 1853. The society refused
this, and the general council was suspended. In 1875 there were 205,000 active members in France, and about 750,000 in the
world. The significant fact in this society is, that it was founded by laymen and has always remained in the hands of laymen,
though in union with and subordinate to the clergy. See <i lang="fr">Grande Encyclop&eacute;die,</i> and Addis and Arnold&#8217;s <i>Cath. Dict.</i>, pp. 844, 845.

asceticism nor laxity, but laid especial emphasis on work, ordering that each monastery have a library. The clothing was generally
black, but was to vary with the needs of the various countries and climates. They were founded in France by St. Maur, a disciple
of St. Benedict, and were introduced into Spain about 633. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries many relaxations crept
into the order, in the reforms of which the congregation of St. Vanne (1550) and the congregation of St. Maur (1618) were
formed in France. The order was entirely suppressed in France at the Revolution, but was later re&euml;stablished there. It was
also suppressed in Spain and Germany, and has not been introduced again in the former country. The order was established first
in the United States in 1846. See Addis and Arnold&#8217;s <i>Cath. Dict.</i>, pp. 74&#8211;76.
